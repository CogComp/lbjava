#### HOW TO RUN #### 

LINUX
====== 
run the following script for separate classifiers:
./scripts/compileLBJ lbj/LALModel.lbj
This lbj file contains a set of independent classifiers for name-entity types and relations.

To get a joint classifier run the following command: 
./scripts/compileLBJ lbj/ER_JointAll.lbj
This file contains a joint inference model, for applying constraints between labels of
entity-classifiers and relation classifiers.

Note: if you want to run training again, first remove the content under lbjsrc directory.
rm -r lbjsrc/*
