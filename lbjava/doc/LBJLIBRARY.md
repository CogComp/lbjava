# The LBJ Library 

The LBJ programming framework is supported by a library of interfaces, learning algorithms,
and implementations of the building blocks described in Chapter 4. This chapter gives a general
overview of each of those codes. .

The library is currently organized into five packages. `LBJ2.classify` contains classes related
to features and classification. `LBJ2.learn` contains learner implementations and supporting
classes. `LBJ2.infer` contains inference algorithm implementations and internal representations
for constraints and inference structures. `LBJ2.parse` contains the Parser interface and some
general purpose internal representation classes. Finally, `LBJ2.nlp` contains some basic natural
language processing internal representations and parsing routines. In the future, we plan to
expand this library, adding more varieties of learners and domain specific parsers and internal
representations.

## `LBJ2.classify`

The most important class in LBJ’s library is `LBJ2.classify.Classifier`. This abstract class
is the interface through which the application accesses the classifiers defined in the LBJ source
file. However, the programmer should, in general, only have need to become familiar with a few
of the methods defined there.

One other class that may be of broad interest is the `LBJ2.classify.TestDiscrete` class
(discussed in Section 5.1.8), which can automate the performance evaluation of a discrete learning
classifier on a labeled test set. The other classes in this package are designed mainly for internal
use by LBJ’s compiler and can be safely ignored by the casual user. More advanced users who
writes their own learners or inference algorithms in the application, for instance, will need to
become familiar with them.

## `LBJ2.classify.Classifier`

Every classifier declaration in an LBJ source file is translated by the compiler into a Java class
that extends this class. When the programmer wants to call a classifier in the application, 
he creates an object of his classifier’s class using its zero argument constructor and calls an
appropriate method on that object. The appropriate method will most likely be one of the
following four methods:

 - `String discreteValue(Object)`: 
  This method will only be overridden in the classifier’s implementation if its feature return
  type is `discrete`. Its return value is the value of the single feature this classifier returns.
 - `double realValue(Object)`:
  This method will only be overridden in the classifier’s implementation if its feature return
  type is real. Its return value is the value of the single feature this classifier returns.
 - `String[] discreteValueArray(Object)`:
  This method will only be overridden in the classifier’s implementation if its feature return
  type is discrete[]. Its return value contains the values of all the features this classifier
  returns.
 - `double[] realValueArray(Object)`:
  This method will only be overridden in the classifier’s implementation if its feature return
  type is real[]. Its return value contains the values of all the features this classifier returns.
  There is no method similar to the four above for accessing the values of features produced
  by a feature generator, since those values are meaningless without their associated names. When
  the programmer wants access to the actual features produced by any classifier (not just feature
  generators), the following non-static method is used. Note, however, that the main purpose of
  this method is for internal use by the compiler.1 
  - `FeatureVector classify(Object)`:
  This method is overridden in every classifier implementation generated by the LBJ compiler.
  It returns a FeatureVector which may be iterated through to access individual features
  (see Section 5.1.3).
  
Every classifier implementation generated by the compiler overrides the following non-static
member methods as well. They provide type information about the implemented classifier.
String getInputType():
This method returns a String containing the fully qualified name of the class this classifier
expects as input.
  
 - `String getOutputType()`:
  This method returns a String containing the feature return type of this classifier. If the
  classifier is discrete and contains a list of allowable values, it will not appear in the output
  of this method.
