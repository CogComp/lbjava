/**
  * Abstract node class that every AST node extends. <br><br>
  *
  * Every AST node must
  * <ul>
  *   <li>
  *     have a unique ID number and store the line and byte offset where it
  *     was found in the source file.
  *   <li>
  *     include a special symbol at the beginning of the Javadoc comment of
  *     each of its AST node child member variables indicating whether that
  *     member variable is allowed to be set to <code>null</code>.  The symbol
  *     (&oslash;) is used to indicate that the variable is allowed to be
  *     <code>null</code>, and the symbol (&not;&oslash;) indicates that the
  *     variable will never be <code>null</code>.
  *   <li>
  *     return an <code>ASTNodeIterator</code> through the abstract
  *     <code>iterator()</code> method that traverses its children in the
  *     order in which the code would be executed.  If the node is composed of
  *     declarative constructs rather than executable code, the iterator will
  *     traverse those constructs in the order in which they appear in the
  *     source.
  *   <li>
  *     override the <code>clone()</code> method such that it returns a deep
  *     copy of itself, except that the line and byte offset of the copy are
  *     both set to <code>-1</code>.
  *   <li>
  *     override the <code>runPass(Pass)</code> method so that it simply calls
  *     the <code>Pass</code>'s <code>run(.)</code> method whose argument type
  *     is the type of the node.
  *   <li>
  *     return a <code>String</code> representation of itself through the
  *     <code>toString()</code> and <code>write(StringBuffer)</code> methods.
  *     Only the <code>write(StringBuffer)</code> method need be overridden by
  *     each node, as <code>toString()</code> will simply invoke
  *     <code>write(StringBuffer)</code> to produce its result.  (This is much
  *     more efficient than having <code>toString()</code> call its childrens'
  *     <code>toString()</code> methods recursively through the AST and
  *     concatenating them all together.)  The <code>String</code> produced
  *     will not be very readable (e.g., it won't contain any new lines), but
  *     it will be compilable by the LBJ compiler.
  * </ul>
  *
  * Most <code>ASTNode</code>s will also contain more than one constructor.
  * There will be one constructor that includes all references to its children
  * as well as line and byte offset information, etc.  This constructor is
  * commonly used by the node's <code>clone()</code> method.  In addition,
  * there may be at least one constructor designed to be more useful for the
  * JavaCUP parser, taking <code>TokenValue</code>s as input.
