dear vince
thanks for your voicemail and delighted to have you confirm lunch on may 1 .
kemm farney the head of wefa ' s electric power services will be travelling
with me this time . i expect there may be other enron colleagues that may
care to join us for lunch so don ' t hesitate to invite as you see fit . for
reservations purposes , perhaps you arrange to let me know numbers .
kemm would also be prepared to informally present our current power outlook
to a larger group at 11 : 00 , if this would be of interest .
as you know , these types of presentations are part of all your wefa energy
retainer package . i will also plan to update you with respect to our current
multi client study schedule for the remainder of the year .
regards , peter
