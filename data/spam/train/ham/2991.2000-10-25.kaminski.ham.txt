hi michele
i am writing to confirm that enron will be participating in the
sales / trading
panel .
i have some great news . we have decided to give enron the sponsorship
spot for the sales and trading panel .
key benifits of being a panel sponsor
- a big enron banner can be displayed indicating that you are the official
sponsor of the entire sales / trading panel
- mention in the program guide and all other conference material
- in addition to the panelist spot on the sales / trading panel , enron
gets to open the panel session with a 15 - 20 min presentation on general
trends in the sales and trading industry , an excellent opportunity
for a senior person from enron to address the audience .
also for folks from enron coming to the conference we have hotel rooms
blocked at a discount price at the park hyatt .
i will be getting you a lot of the details with regards to logistics for the
panel and enrons participation in the conference in the coming weeks . .
once again , i would like to thank you for the sponsorship and presence at
the finance conference .
looking forward to it . .
regards
suresh balasubramanian
