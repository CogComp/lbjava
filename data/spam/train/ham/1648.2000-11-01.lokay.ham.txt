high natural gas prices , performance issues and higher than expected
maintenance costs , a general economic slowdown and several other key factors
will combine to create a " near - term meltdown in the gas turbine market , "

fuel - switching is not living up to its advance billing ; units may not perform
as well at high ambient temperatures ; overhauls are required more frequently
than had been expected ; maintenance costs also are exceeding expectations ;
and fuel quality is becoming an issue .
