chris ,
i have read the paper . it reads very well . two comments .
1 . it probably makes sense to include a note on the standard gbm simulation
equation and
the way it ' s typically discretized .
2 . it will help the reader who did not read the earlier articles to explain
what ct is ( perhaps a footnote ) .
i am also including a message i sent to julie today .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
1 . i would like to register 2 members of my group for both courses ( in
houston ) :
a . paulo issler
b . alex huang
i shall attend the course on weather only .
2 . i have started the process to issue a check for 5 , 000 aud for lacima .
shirley sent you an update on this . the 2 nd installment comes from the budget
of our
office in australia . i shall talk to paul quilkey today about it . please , let
me know if there is any delay .
3 . the book will be used as textbook for the class i shall be teaching at
rice .
rice univ bookshop is placing an order .
4 . i would like to order 50 copies for my group . what is the best
way to place the order ? can we pay in us dollars ?
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
best regards .
vince
