i called him at home last night . his absence from the office this week was somewhat unplanned . he is at home with his kids as his mother inlaw is taking a break for the week ( remember , he has four kids , including a two - month old baby and his son erik who has had a variety of health problems ) . he is planning on coming in at the end of the week to interview some internal people for a job on the services desk . i agree that it looks like he is out of here , but he gave me no indication . i think that we should sit tight for a few days . i will know when he ' s coming in to do the services interviews . perhaps amy should have a conversation with him at that time .
