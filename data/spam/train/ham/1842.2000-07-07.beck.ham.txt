subject : unify to sap interface - - - day 2
as on day 1 we ran the unify to sap interface at 8 : 00 am , noon , and 3 : 00 pm .
set out below are the results of these runs .
the interfaces for enron north america ( financial for gas , weather , and pulp
and paper ) were error free .
the interfaces for ena global products - - financial resulted in two invoices
not being accepted by sap . this was due to a sap error that has occurred
about three times in test . however , the sap team cannot duplicate the error
in order to correct . they are still trying to find the root of this problem .
the two transactions which were not picked up by sap were resent successfully .
the interfaces for ena fx financial uncovered a breakdown in the process . the
payment program for this entity is to be processed manually by the accounts
payable dept . for july 5 and today , the ap dept . forgot to process the
payment program resulting in nine payments ( 7 us $ , 1 canadian , and 1 gbp )
not being paid . we were able to get all payments out today through sap
except the gbp payment . the gbp non - payment was discovered by a counterparty
calling and stating that they did not received their funds . the us $ and
canadian non - payments were discovered when we reviewed our bank statements
and found that the funds were not disbursed . for future interfaces , bernard
is to call treasury after each interface is processed to ensure that the
payments for this entity were received by them .
