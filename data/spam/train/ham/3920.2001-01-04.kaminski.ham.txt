Subject: henwood stuff and thoughts about valuation
did you guys get this ?
i was too interested in the conversation to interrupt with comments about
risk / return if the decision would be covered in rates , it is the
customers ' curves or equivalently the puc ' s curve .
i think if i were going to approach valuation in commodities where the
assumptions of black / scholes do not apply , i would start with the capm for
large industries in an area , use pro formas to translate this to utility
curves for the input commodities , and add the utility curves .
another issue : the factor that explains why enron is lowest bidder is its
role in the market . in the 1930 s , keynes argued that if most market
participants with long position were hedgers , futures prices would be higher
than spot ; if they were speculators or traders , future prices would be lower
than spot . traders must be compensated for holding the risk ; hedgers
( including utilities and consumers ) are willing to pay a premium for the
certainty . consequently , enron traders have bigger bid / ask spreads and lower
bid prices .
just some random thoughts ,
