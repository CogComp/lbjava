louise ,
we have been trying to get something arranged for this friday . ubs has special events personnel that arrange these types of events including what we saw at the houstonian a few weeks ago . it is my understanding that we are awaiting approval from mike hutchins before making any arrangements . informally , i have spoken with jillian ' s and sambuca regarding availability for a friday afternoon event . however , absent using yours or greg ' s credit card , we will need approval through ubs prior to booking any formal event .
kind regards ,
julie
