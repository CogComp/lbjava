we have had issues in the past with canada not informing us of all of their
merchant investments . for six months we chased invasion debt and finally
received enough information to put it on the mpr in august ( only after it was
placed in raptor i ) . also , about six months ago , john lavorato asked about
an asset called cnr warrants that showed up on the " hot list " but we were
told by canada that they were going to sell it so they did not want it on the
mpr . today , we were told that kyle kitagawa wanted to sell an asset called
genoil ( approx . 4 . 7 million shares ) . again , we did not know that they owned
this investment . we have contacted donna lowry about genoil because beau
canada is on the restricted list and think genoil would be , too .
a trip to canada may be necessary in order to reinforce our full disclosure
policies regarding the mpr . please let me know if i can provide any
additional information .
