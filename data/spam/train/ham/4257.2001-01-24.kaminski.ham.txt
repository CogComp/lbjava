kim :
the interviews conducted on february 2 are just exploratory interviews to
see where punit might fit within enron . vince thought he might fit in john ' s
group .
the title and $ $ amount will not be determined until it is decided where he
should be ( if at all ) . if john is interested after the interview , then he and
vince can get together to discuss $ $ and title .
if you or john have any other questions , please let me know .
thanks !

punit is a carnegie mellon student that will be graduating with an ms in
computational finance in may 2001 . several of our guys interviewed him
at carnegie mellon recently and were very impressed . vince says that he
is definately a trading candidate .
would john be interested in interviewing him ? i am attaching his resume
for you to look over and then let me know if john would be interested .
thanks !
have a merry christmas !
