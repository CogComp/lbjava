subject : follow - up on siam workshop
i enjoyed your presentation , and meeting you briefly afterwards , at the
siam workshop last friday .
i have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and
development of modeling and simulation software products , mostly
for the oil and gas pipeline industry .
i am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and
mathematical skills . getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline
simulation industry would be a plus .
please consider whether i might fit in your group . your answer to a
question indicated that i have several of the skills you look for .
also , please let me know , by email , the names and contact information of
other managers within enron who might benefit from having someone with
my qualifications in their group .
attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting
experience . publications are available on request .
i will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email .
thank you for your time .
