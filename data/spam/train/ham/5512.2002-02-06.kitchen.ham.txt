Subject: re : releases
louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a " management " slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,
claudia

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks
louise
