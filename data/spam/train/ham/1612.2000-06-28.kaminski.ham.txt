conrad ,
thanks for your message .
there are 3 papers enron contributed to the last mepr .
there is also another paper on electricity i contributed to the " red book " on
us
power markets , as well as a paper or credit risk management , and a paper
on weather derivatives . all these papers included in other risk books were
written by enron
employees .
we would like them included as well , if technically possible .
i think that offering other energy related books through our site , in
addition to mepr 2 ,
is fine , but i would leave the decision to dan diamond , who is responsible
for the project .

> regarding the enron site , i think it is absolutely fine to put up the two
enron chapters ( i ' ll provide pdfs ) , and prevent any customer leakages from
your site by the use of " submit " buttons . as mentioned , i ' ll offer a 20 %
discount on mepr 2 to customers but would you be interested in some of other
energy titles ? - please let me know .
