Subject: re : summer internship
thanks dr . kaminski ,
i forgot that : - )
i ' ll understand it as
i may identify work that i think will be
beneficial to both of us .
actually ,
i have more ideas on the work , beyond the suggestion .
i ' ll work on it and send it in more formal way again .
( i mean , work list , schedule , deliverables etc )
i ' ll take steps to get work permit for those two months .
and please tell me know what you can support
and what i should start to do to find a place to stay ,
rent a car etc .
warm regards ,
jinbaek
