dear vincent ,
as i told you on the phone on friday , i am very interested in a summer
internship at enron . i would like to point out that i want to pursue a
career in trading , and i am especially interested in derivatives . given that
enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy , broadband and weather
derivatives , i find it a company i would be most interested in working for .
i believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm , and i
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours . i have
final exams from march 19 - 22 , but would be most willing to travel to houston
for interviews any time from friday march 23 rd onwards . i hope to hear from
you soon .
best regards ,
