christie :
congratulations ! i don ' t know how you manage to work full - time at enron
and study for a phd at the same time . sounds superhuman to me !
the fedex was marked for saturday delivery , but in case you haven ' t
received it yet , i ' m enclosing the draft as an attachment .
it would be great if we could get enron ' s approval during our visit . ( i
know professors at hbs are interested in teaching that case as soon as it ' s
available . )
thanks for all your help , and let me know if you have any questions ,
comments , etc .
best ,
meg
