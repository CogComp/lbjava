subject : rotational opportunities within your group
dear vince ,
i am a rotating associate and would like to learn more about opportunities
within your group . i have worked in rac and am currently in financial
trading . i believe the associate / analyst program may forward you my cv , but i
thought it good to get in touch personally .
please let me know if there is someone with whom i could speak about the
group and its needs for associates .
with best regards ,
kate
