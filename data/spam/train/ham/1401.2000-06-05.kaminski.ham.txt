dale ,
omer muften ( with the structuring group ) asked us to help in evaluating the
different options embedded in the storm contract . however , he promised to
provide us with the forward curves regarding the dark fiber ( in europe ) . we
are still waiting to receive those . in addition , it seems that the deal
structure has " just " changed . i will give you a call to discuss .
