subject : enron management conference - home video project
the enron management conference will be held wednesday through friday , november 14 - 16 , 2001 , at the westin la cantera resort in san antonio . while the business agenda is still being finalized , there is one thing that is certain . . . we want to inject some humor into the event . the past year has been eventful , and at times challenging , for enron and its employees . however , it ' s not in enron ' s corporate fabric to focus on the past . instead , we want to look ahead , and even laugh at ourselves . the management conference will provide a platform for just that .
we want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous " home video " to be presented at the management conference . the video can address any enron - related topic that your business unit chooses . however , there are a few rules to follow .
1 . ) the videos should be no more than five minutes long .
2 . ) business units should spend as little as possible on the videos , and no more than $ 10 , 000 . innovision communications ( beth stier ) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original , inexpensive video . innovision can be contacted at 713 - 446 - 4424 .
3 . ) the videos should be fun , but not disparaging . they should adhere to enron ' s values of respect , integrity , communication and excellence .
4 . ) by monday , october 15 , business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video . to avoid duplication , business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address .
5 . ) to ensure inclusion in the management conference agenda , videos need to be submitted to me by friday , november 9 .
6 . ) awards will be given for creativity and humor . the first annual , and soon - to - be - coveted , " enny " will also be awarded for " best overall video . "
if you have any questions about the " home video " project , please contact myself or mary clark .
