are dash ' s required before any $ $ are spent , or is there a threshhold ? i don ' t think that jacoby gets dash ' s for any of his projects and he has spent over $ 1 mm on 4 of his florida sites .

could be related to the amount spent on the ft pierce project that we looked at last week .
procedures look ok . i thought the developers were already responsible for dollars spent on projects .
i guess the point about accounting setting up approved budget limits kind of addresses our responsibility when the spent amounts approach the limit . but theresa & i have had that discussion before . what do we do and who do we notify if we see the total spend approaching or passing the dashed amount . it shows up on the cost summarywe give the developer , but should we bring it to the attention of someone other than the developer ?
based on the discussions thursday pierce , jody

any ideas on what prompted this or comments on the procedures ? ? ?

we need to put this into action from a tracking point of view . this is a result of an over spent dash . any comment ?
