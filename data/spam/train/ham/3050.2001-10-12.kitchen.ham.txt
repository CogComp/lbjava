Subject: title stuff
louise , just not to leave this item pending . you asked me to talk to steve and think about a differen ttitle . . . after hours of deliberation , i propose to you that we keep the regular us title ( director ) , and we avoid any confusion . in terms of our customers i ' ll just tell them i am director for the monterrey office .
let me know if you are ok so i can immediately correct my business cards .
thanks and have agood weekend .
