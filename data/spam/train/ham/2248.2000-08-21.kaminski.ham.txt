Subject: li sun
vince ,
thanks for your response . apparently , we were under the incorrect impression
that your group would be taking li ( based on jeff ' s note below ) . we
apologize for not contacting you last friday to confirm prior to " placing " li
in your group . i have faxed li ' s resume to you and hope that you will have
time to review it today . please call me back as soon as you can to discuss
li ' s opportunities in your group .
if vince is not interested in li for his group , we will consider li placed in
ena - gas trading ( original placement ) in john lavorato ' s organization . once
i hear from vince one way or the other , the program will consider li ' s
placement final in either research or ena - gas trading . hopefully this will
be resolved by tuesday morning so that we may communicate to li her rotation
information . if you have any questions , please let me know .
thank you !

shelly ,
i shall not accept anybody for a rotation without a prior interview .
li was scheduled to meet with me last thursday but she never showed
up . she did not call to cancel or to apologize for not showing up .
i have not seen her resume .

shelly ,
hunter spoke with li today and agrees that her first rotation should be in
vince ' s group doing modelling , etc . this will give her the broadest
experience for a first rotation . i ' m sure the other person in question ,
vikas , will do very well in hunter ' s group .
thanks for your help .
