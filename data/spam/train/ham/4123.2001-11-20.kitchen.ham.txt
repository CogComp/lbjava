Subject: enron direct canada corp . - lc ' s expiring 12 / 31 / 2001
sent on behalf of derek flaman :
the following is a response to bill ' s question : " when does the tariff require the lc to be renewed ? do we have some time to wait until mid - december ? "
also attached to this email is lori poffenroth ' s november 9 memo which sets forth lori ' s calculations based on wsp / ppa ' s formulas set forth in their tariffs for initial amounts , revised amounts , recommended october 31 amounts , and estimated december 31 amounts .
all of the wsp ' s and the ppa ' s prudential requirements allow the wsp ' s and the ppa to reevaluate edcc ' s credit limit and / or request additional security from time to time . while the following sets out in more detail the manner in which each wsp and the ppa can do this , all of the prudential requirements are the same in the following two respects : ( 1 ) if at any time edcc ' s financial obligations to the wsp / ppa ( the " financial obligations " ) exceed the existing credit limit ( or a certain percentage thereof ) , the wsp / ppa has the right to request additional security ( the " additional security " ) ; and ( 2 ) if edcc fails to post the additional security within the requisite time period , the wsp / ppa reserves the right to suspend service to edcc .
note that , as of today , no wsp / ppa has requested additional security .
however , as soon as possible , the following needs to occur in those instances where the october 31 amount exceeds the existing amount : ( 1 ) we should post the additional security now ; or ( 2 ) we put ourselves in a position to be able to post the additional security within the requisite time period . consequently , we do have some time to wait until mid - december provided that ( 2 ) has occurred .
as at december 31 , we must post the december 31 amount .
