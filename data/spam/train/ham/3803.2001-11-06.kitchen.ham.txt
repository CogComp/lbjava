louise ,
i have completed a review our current requirements for services from eeos as well as those for 2002 . at present , we are using bill fox to support the coal initiative . in addition , we are using ed danhaus for city of austin warranty work . all work by eeos to support the site acquisition and development initiatives including ft pierce have been terminated or are being terminated . matt tezyk has just completed an inventory of the westinghouse equipment ( d 5 a ) that we own that is currently in dispute . while we are not currently using eeos for vitro , tractebel has a call on named eeos personnel at the project budget through november of 02 . we have an obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to subsititute others if these individuals are not available . all these requirements as well as any others can be met from virgo ' s group in 2002 . therefore , we have no requirements from eeos in 2002 .
neither west power nor canada are currently using eeos . the longview project is in the pre - ntp phase . a buyer could elect to use eeos as the turnkey contractor but would not be obligated to use them nor would we be obligated to offer eeos services in the sale . they do not anticipate using eeos in 2002 . likewise , canada will not use them in 2002 .
enron sa is currently using 1 - 2 engineers from eeos on a full time basis . this requirement could increase ( slightly ) in 2002 if they phase out their inernal group . however they would also be comfortable using third party vendors in sa . thus , they do not require eeos .
