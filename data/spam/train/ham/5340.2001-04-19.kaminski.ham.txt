hi tanya ,
in my view it is very good if stig and kirstee are involved in your var
meetings . therefore , i think it is very useful for them to call houston .
could we get a little bit better equipment to allow them to hear everything
well ?
many thanks ,
slava

hi slava ,
kirstee and i find it useful to listen in on the var meetings in houston on
wednesdays .
however , it is very difficult to follow the discussion due to a practical
problem : we hear little or nothing at times .
a possible solution to this problem might be to ask whether one could install
a " spider phone " in the var meeting room .
what i mean is a phone similar to the one in the rac morning meetings which
have several remote speakers going out
from the main phone ( do you understand what i mean ? ) . if this is done , we
would hear everyone around the table ,
not just those seated close to the phone .
what is you opinion on
a . us in london calling in to these meetings
b . getting some better equipment which would make it easier to follow the
conversation ( " spider phone " or bigger speaker . . )
please let me know what your thoughts are ,
best regards ,
stig
