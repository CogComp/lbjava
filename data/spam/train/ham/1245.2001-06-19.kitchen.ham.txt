Subject: revised new albany analysis
i will be circulating in the next few minutes a revised new albany analysis . the only revisions that were made were to correct : ( 1 ) the cost basis ( as of 3 / 31 / 01 ) , ( 2 ) the monthly depreciation amount ( which actually diverges from the budgeted amount ) and ( 3 ) the spare parts basis . i have double checked with cris sherman and theresa vos and they are in agreement with these numbers . the total impact of these changes is a reduction to the pv margin of $ 2 , 316 , 000 . i apologize for the mistake but hope that you understand that the mistake arose from errors in the information that was supplied to me .
