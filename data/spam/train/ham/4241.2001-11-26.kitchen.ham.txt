Subject: new york , etc .
well . . . i am back and checking in with you .
several things :
1 ) russell ' s mom passed away on friday . funeral is tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 4 : 00 p . m . in lubbock , texas . i am trying to make arrangements to attend , but it doesn ' t look probable due to flights .
2 ) i want your input on canceling the ny trip . i appreciate your support in letting me proceed to this point . the remaining benefit was to get everyone together with you to calm the nerves and set a course . i understand you will not be able to attend . it seems there is a general public belief ( from pec & keyspan ) that many enron employees will not have a job after this week . if they believe that , it is entirely inappropriate to be doing anything celebratory or we will be deemed as ruthless . i want to make this call immediately . we have only spent an incremental $ 500 . 00 in the reviving of this event .
3 ) per my e - mail on 11 / 16 , i want to ensure that ena retains deirdre mccaffrey who is currently in the freight group . can we please move her into my group ?
4 ) a small investment firm has approached us with an inquiry into enovate . they want us to sign a confidentiality to discuss further . your thoughts . . .
5 ) per our conversation last week , i have not received any package at my home .
5 ) is there anything productive i can do to help you ?
