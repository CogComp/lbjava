Subject: re : ll visa - anshuman shrivastava
molly : for your information , i received this reply from anshuman today .
as i mentioned in my voicemail to you today after seeing the note from neil
mcgregor , there is no possible way that anshuman could be in the us to work
on february 5 th . until i receive all of his documents , and the necessary
information from you regarding his position in the us , i do not have the
information to send to the attorneys for the visa application .
once they receive the paperwork , they will need to prepare the documents in
triplicate , and send to me . at this stage , i will send the documents to
anshuman in india and he will need to make an appointment at the us consulate
in order to have the ll visa stamped into his passport . he will not be able
to come to the states to work without this visa in his passport ! all of this
could take approx . 3 - 4 weeks to accomplish . i think march would be a more
realistic timeframe !
please let me have your thoughts .
thanks
margaret

anshuman : please go ahead and complete the visa questionnaire and send the
required documents so that i can proceed with your working visa for the us .
regardless of the length of time you will be in the us , you will still need
the ll visa in order to work here .
many thanks
