Subject: re :
my order is actually future p \ l based . if it wasn ' t in enron n . a . i would put calger way higher . ie - if it was pulp and paper and i knew that we wouldn ' t have the opportunity to trade size , chris would be in the top 3 . maybe 1 . but in this market we need to have the people who can make over 100 mm every year . just thinking .

subject : re :
i didn ' t get a copy of dave ' s email but a few comments and i attach a compromise ordering . i added to your file schoolyard .
our differences are :
me - don miller , joe deffner , chris foster
you - zipper , ermis , aucoin
i would put them all ahead of bernie however i have no data points apart from p & l on nothing with frank so i can ' t comment on him . . not huge differences in order , apart from your slant on canadians ! the main issue with yours is calger behind benson and zufferli ( and even maybe dana ) , he ' s a future leader of this organisation . your ordering is very p & l based .
are we supposed to cover wes or will causey ?
i added to your file schoolyard .
speak to you later .
