attached is a file containing the following information for your management meeting in beaver creek ( august 16 - 19 , 2001 ) :
preliminary agenda
cost estimate
outside speaker options
i am holding 3 enron aircraft for this event and have included that price in the cost estimate .
i have reviewed all the video tapes for the outside speakers with the exception of the political humorists . the only one that i would not recommend is joe malarkey . i thought his material was ' pure malarkey ' - but that is just my opinion . i have bios if you would like to see them . we are not limited to this list - i can check pricing and availability for anyone that you would like to suggest .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments .
thanks .
