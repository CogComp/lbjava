Subject: napoleonville land
louise ,
reliant did not acquire the land on friday evening because :
enron does not have a complete chain of title . we only had it going back to our acquisition of the land . they have gone to the court house this weekend to get relevant documents .
we will not indemnify them on potential environmental issues - but they should have done due dilgence this past weekend .
i am confident that we will send the land to either texas brine or reliant . reliant will be contacting me today regarding the prior two issues and as stated on friday , they have already cut a cashier ' s check for $ 3 million .
regards , mrha
