Subject: it infrastructure plan
kim mentioned that you ' re on the phone . jenny designated the disaster recovery piece ( $ 10 m ) and some other items as capital expenses , and we neglected to include this in our schedule . the total capital budget is $ 14 . 7 m . i presume that you ' ll want to include this amount ?
what we currently have is expense plan of 24 . 9 m with a 1 . 2 multiple equals 30 . 2 m .
i think we ' ll want to amend it :
24 . 9 m expense
14 . 7 m capital
39 . 6 m total ( would you still want a multiple to increase to 47 . 5 m ? )
we have a call in for en ops as well to make sure that there isn ' t any potential capital plan we might need to include .
please let me know !
