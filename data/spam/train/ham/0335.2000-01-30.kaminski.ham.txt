stinson ,
as you requested , i spoke with brad mcsherry concerning the position , salary ,
and immediate supervisor . i asked brad to provide a formal letter of offer
and informed him that i needed it before the end of business friday .
unfortunately , i have not received the letter thus far . although the job was
well defined , i felt that the administrative details of the position were not
clearly laid out . for example , i specifically asked last week who my manager
would be and was told that it would be you . however , i later found out ( by
chance ) that this was not the case . also , it was unclear whether i would be
in the research group or in enron communications .
although these two issues are not critical and under normal circumstances
would be resolved , given previous confusion regarding my role and
compensation with the research group , i feel less comfortable accepting the
position . to be specific , there was an unnecessary struggle regarding my
interview reimbursement and there were problems regarding my bonus . in
general i feel that there has been a significant lack of communication and
respect .
therefore i feel that i am left with the decision not to make the move to
enron and feel that it would be in everyone ' s best interest not to pursue
this any further . thank you .
