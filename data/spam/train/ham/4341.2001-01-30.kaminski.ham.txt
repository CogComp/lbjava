ronnie ,
regarding the parking situation downtown
the closest parking garage with visitor parking is the one at allens center .
your agenda , to define
- what the scope of the project is
- what do you expect of the project - - in other words what are you trying to
find out from the study , this will help define the scope
- discuss a timeline
- tools that we can use at enron
- are there any projects at enron ( past or present ) that we can draw on or
build on
sounds good . do you all have the original scope vince wrote up ? although it
is broad , its a good beginning for your scope . once you flesh - out the scope ,
we ' ll see if any existing reports can be found that may be helpful .
regarding industry research
check out red herring and other online resources .
see you later
