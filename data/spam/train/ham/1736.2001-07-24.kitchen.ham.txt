louise ,
here are some bullet points for the discussions tomorrow :
- east power , including generation investments made about $ 50 million in the first half . the greatest contribution came from ben jacoby , about $ 15 million . by the way , i hired ben along with scott healy to acquire sites in 1998 .
- all of the traders and structuring , including bernie aucoin told me that john llodra drove both the cmp and nstar deals . total income $ 8 . 5 million .
- i believe delainey was correct in saying that ozzie was the brains behind alamac but heather did the execution . total income for the east $ 7 . 5 million .
- most of the rest of the deals were done after i came in .
- mid market sales have increased . ( 700 % over the first half of 2000 )
- this group was in meltdown when i came in ( at least on the origination side ) . i would like to get some credit for stopping the bleeding and starting the rebuilding process in a difficult environment .
