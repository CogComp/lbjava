our most important , non - top 20 counterparty in the west is pacificorp ( the utility , not ppm ) . pacificorp is the most important counterparty for both our short term northwest an short term southwest desks . as we allocate scarce margin , please keep this in mind .

fyi . . . we may want to think about our response to this while keeping in mind that trading values this cp for short - term southwest trading .
