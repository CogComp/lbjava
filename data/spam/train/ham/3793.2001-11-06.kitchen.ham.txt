Subject: my boss again
louise ,
i understand from michael brown that you are my boss again ( lucky you ) . i also understand that you have a ton of things on your plate but i have an issue that needs to be addressed and your help / clarification would be much appreciated .
i am not sure whether we are going be shutting things down or going slow over near term but the guys in the states are canceling contracts with european clients that could lead to lawsuits and will severely harm the business .
less urgent is a deal that is in document / credit that we have put on the backburner , which could generate significant revenues this quarter ( between $ 30 and $ 40 million in pv on an index deal ) . i would like to discuss .
regards ,
bruce
