hi stinson ,
thanks for meeting with us on thursday . we enjoyed
talking with you .
as per our discussion , i have attached the course
outline of java for managers along with this email .
after our conversation with you we think this course
may be a little bit heavy for your group . but we can definetly
take it down to concepts level and make it appropriate for
our audience . please review and let me know , if this
course would be of value to you . this is a 3 day course
and costs $ 11 , 000 ( maximum of 15 students ) .
regards ,
