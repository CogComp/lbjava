new york , aug . 23 / prnewswire / - - electricity trading continued to move
online in the past six months , but most wholesale power deals are still being
done through traditional voice brokerages , the latest energy argus survey has
found . internet - based trading now makes up 38 % of trading in the us , up from
28 . 5 % in february and 25 % in april 2000 , according to argus data .
most online trading is done through either or
enrononline , each of which have more than a third of the electronic market ,
the survey of 40 power traders found . however , another 24 % of the
transactions are completed through a variety of other platforms , including
dynegydirect , bloomberg powermatch and tradespark .
although their market share has declined from 75 % two years ago , traditional
brokers continue to process most power trades , due to their ability to offer
options and other derivatives , their dominance in the short - term physical
markets and some trading houses ' reluctance to embrace online technology .
