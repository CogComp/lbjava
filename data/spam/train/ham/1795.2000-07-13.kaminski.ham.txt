dear mr kaminski
i am delighted to say that the printed conference brochure is now available
and our logistics team will be mailing them out , along with the speaker
guideline packs ( including information on hotel discounts etc ) , in the next
couple of weeks . you will also no doubt receive copies via our main mailing
campaign .
in the interim , please find attached a shortened pdf copy of the conference
brochure for your perusal . ( i did not want to send you the complete 12 pages
as it would clog up your email ! ) the full colour version can be found on our
website at www . icbi . uk . com / powerisk
i hope you agree that the speaker plenum and line - up of topics is possibly
one of the best ever and not surprisingly the event is already drawing strong
international interest . in particular the executive summit day on e - business
and power trading is taking numerous bookings . i would be happy for you to
attend either the summit day or one of our two intensive post conference
workshops , but in order to avoid overcrowding on the day ask that all
reservations be made in advance .
i am certain that you have friends or colleagues who would be interested in
attending the conference this year , and would like to ask that you email the
enclosed details to them . to make things easy , i have attached a booking form
which should be faxed to + 44 20 7915 5101 . icbi would be happy to offer a 10 %
discount on registrations received through speaker recommendations .
finally for any enquiries relating to travel or hotel matters please contact
our logistics manager clare capel on + 44 20 7915 5198 . of course for any
programme related issues , please drop me an email or call me on + 44 20 7915
5194 .
i look forward to seeing you in october for what promises to be excellent and
informative week .
kind regards
