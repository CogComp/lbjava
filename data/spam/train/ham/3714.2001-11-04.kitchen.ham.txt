subject : support services for ena
so here ' s how it works . the attached spreadsheet has three master worksheets :
( i ) energy operations
( ii ) it
( iii ) support services
all the rest of the worksheets are back up documentation for the rankings .
please identify the people on the masters who actually have contracts .
thanks
louise
