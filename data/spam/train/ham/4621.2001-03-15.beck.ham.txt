philippe , greg , rex -
we have followed up with cgi on their " secret " target for our applications .
it is cms energy
across town . they will be presenting a careful ( and short ) concept proposal
to them on the 26 th of march .
initial feedback on enron being part of the solution was very positive by the
business owner of the
rearchitecture . apparently , there is a significant process flow rework going
on at the same time
and the business owner reports to the ceo on both topics .
we are in early in the process so there is room to still influence the
overall approach they take ,
according to cgi .
