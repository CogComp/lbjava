subject : surplus industrial supply could relieve mexico ' s summer power shortage - cera insight
title : mexican power markets : cfe looks to industrial generators for excess power , but many questions remain
url ( s ) :
surplus industrial supply could relieve mexico ' s summer power shortage
power plants being built under the comision reguladora de energia ' s ( cfe )
independent power producer program will not be available until the end of the
year , leaving a very tight market during the summer peak demand season .
president vicente fox recently announced that the cfe would increase the
capacity that industrial generators could sell back to the national grid . the
initiative was met with resistance by many members of mexico ' s congress ,
however , and has been suspended pending judicial review . the success of the
program will depend on three factors :
* is there enough surplus capacity available where it is needed ?
* is the cfe willing to offer an attractive price ?
* will the courts allow it to happen ?
* * end * *
