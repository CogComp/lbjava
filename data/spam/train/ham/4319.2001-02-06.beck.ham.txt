sally : ? i am refiguring this meeting . . . i have tried three places and can not
find a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance , so i checked
notes . . . you were correct , pam martins dad and emily u . dad were both
volunteered by their wives , i will check them out this evening . ? i have call
into bob lindsay , policeman and ncl dad , about safety . . we will see . ? i
thought i might try to get some brief info from ann young on applause
theatre , our new phil . ? on nominations , there were a couple of girls who did
not complete info sheets last time , i will call them tonight . ? also , i can
check with the three on nominations and see when they are available , will
let you know . ? if you don ' t mind having regular ticktocker meeting at your
house , that would be great . ? if all else fails , sarah marshall ( yes , that is
right ) probably knows more about car care than anyone i know . . . the girls
call her if their car doesn ' t start . ? her theory is that the first thing is
to turn down the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ radio as you are backing out the drive , so you can
hear your car . . . pretty basic . ?
summary : ? can we do tt meeting at your house ? ? i will email agenda for that
meeting to you . ? i will have abi check with girls about nominations and let
you know when they can meet . . . we will go from there . ? is this okay with
you . ? this is the meeting i thought we might dd dad / dtr but too close , so
we better come up with another idea . . . . dance lesson , maybe . . . think megan
suggested that . ?
