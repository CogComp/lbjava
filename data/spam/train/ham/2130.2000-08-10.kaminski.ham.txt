Subject: yesterday
i enjoyed meeting you both yesterday to discuss my sincere interest in the
research group .
since many of the rotations for analysts are pre - determined , i think it is
best for me to wait until my candidacy
for the analyst program is finalized .
thank you for your interest in my skill - set . i am enrolled in the cfa
program , have completed numerous futures / options
courses in undergraduate school , and am confident that my profile will be
well - received after completing your in - house
project which will be utilized to test certain skills .
i ' ll talk to you soon after my discussions with the analyst program .
regards ,
david
