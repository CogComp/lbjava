subject : columbia gulf order on negotiated rates
i received a copy of an order issued by the ferc on columbia negotiated rate transaction , which includes a formula ie indexed rate . they accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring them to file in their tariff within one day after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate . ( each time the actual rate changes during the term ) just think about this for the upcoming tw _ usgt deal and nng " - reliant deals . notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing , the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day - - - i believe this is ferc ' s way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals - they are punishing themselves as well , as each filing will require a notice etc - so every day they could need to issue an order .
i feel we need to discuss with columbia , ingaa and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare . an alternative would be to require you to post on internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate , so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate . i ' m sending you guys a copy of the order .
