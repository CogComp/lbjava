access |
tony ,
earl harvey and i are located on the 19 th floor inside the corporate research
group ' s area , which is in a secured area . they are a very supportive and
cooperative group , and conditions here are ideal for research , analysis , and
writing . i don ' t want to jeopardize their security in any way , but , if
possible , i would like to be added to the after hours and weekend access list
for situations such as meeting deadlines and research and that if you did not concur with my request , then
there
would be no reason to copy him at all .
thanks ,
jay
