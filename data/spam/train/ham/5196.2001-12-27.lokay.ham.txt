subject : pg & e prepayment december 26 .
fyi
i received a voice mail from jack foley at pg & e wanting to breakup the prepayment ( $ 1 , 700 , 000 ) due december 26 into four weekly installments . my response is to reject that request and walk him through tw with the most current information . this would be similar to what kevin did with two vendors this morning , nuovo pignone and labarge steel .
regards .
