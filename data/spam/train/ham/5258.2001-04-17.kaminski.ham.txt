Subject: karthik rajan
i spoke with karthik this morning about our offer , and answered some additional questions that he had . he has accepted our offer , but with one additional request . he would now like for us to ship his car . i asked him why he couldn ' t drive it down here , and he said that it was too old . i am going to check with relocation for an approximate cost and will get back to you . . . .
thanks ,
molly
