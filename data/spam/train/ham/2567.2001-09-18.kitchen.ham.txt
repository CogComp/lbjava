re canada : rob is predicting $ 462 mm canadian cash balance for year end . approx half is due to organic cash flow . the rest is a byproduct of slapshot . i ' ve got a call into wes to see if these numbers were in the 2 nd current estimate or not . i ' ve talked with stephen douglas about getting the cash back early through a repurchase of the preferred shares ecc issued to corp earlier this year . i should have more info by our mtg this afternoon .
