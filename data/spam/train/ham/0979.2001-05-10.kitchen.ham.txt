i have a call in to ben to discuss the idea . with respect to your message on steve pearlman , i worked with him for about a year . he is extremely intelligent and knowledgeable of the power industry . he sometimes has a tendency to over - analyze issues , but i think he understands risks in the industry much more than many people in our organization . he has closed and can close transaction . i have a lot of respect for him and i think he will more than pay for himself in the long - run ( responding to your question on how much he will make ) .

subject : turbines
what i was trying to call you about was an idea . the way ben and chris currently run the turbine book is they share everything 50 : 50 - upsides and downsides . i thought it might be a good idea to involve you so the turbine book is split 33 : 33 : 33 . obviously there is a transfer price out to projects ( internal and riogen would be included ) but this would mean our successful turbine team would have all the right incentives to assist you with the mitsubishis .
if you think its a good idea - please talk to ben or chris ( calger ) who have discussed this themselves .
you would need an out for riogen agreed upfront .
