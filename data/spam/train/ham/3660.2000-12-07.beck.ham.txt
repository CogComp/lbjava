larry ,
the ena accounting groups have had wires for our nymex and otc margin calls
sent back due to improper signatures . the timely flow of these monies is a
vital component to our trading organization . i believe that these two items
fall under category " b " of the policy memo that was distributed ( see email
below ) and therefore should only require the signature of an accounting
director .
( b ) those that are approved by an underlying contract or rac require an
accounting director approval of the payment and general ledger coding .
we have a contractual obligation to our brokers and otc counterparties to
provide margin according to the guidelines set forth in our agreements with
them . these margin calls / returns of margin are monitored and amounts
signed off on by the rac credit group ( bill bradford ' s area ) . backup from
the credit group should be and is included with each wire .
i would appreciate your consideration of the above arguments to facilitate
the movement of these monies on a go - forward basis . i will call you tomorrow
to discuss the possibility of having this change in effect for monday dec .
11 . thank you .

subject : updated - approval authorizations
as mentioned in my previous memo regarding cash control standards , approval
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment . corporate
accounts payable is actively pursuing a " workflow " system to route invoice
images for approval and processing . this workflow solution will not be
implemented until early 2001 . in the interim , an approval process will be
implemented by ap and treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and
correct general ledger coding . effective monday , november 20 the following
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices , payment requests
and wire transfer requests that are $ 1 , 000 , 000 or greater :
( a ) those not approved by an underlying contract or rac require two
approvals : a managing director approval of the payment , and an accounting
director approval of the general ledger coding .
( b ) those that are approved by an underlying contract or rac require an
accounting director approval of the payment and general ledger coding .
in both examples above , supporting documentation must be attached . if not
attached , then the payment will not be processed .
to assist us with implementing this approval process , i ' m requesting each of
you to accumulate signatures of the managing directors and accounting
directors in your business unit using the attached form . please forward this
information to larry dallman ( jfr 568 ) by friday , november 10 th .
this new process becomes effective monday , november 20 th . it important to
provide this information or payments greater than $ 1 , 000 , 000 will not be
processed .
