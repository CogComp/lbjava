Subject: inquery re : aluminium companies
vince ,
margaret mentioned to me that you might be able to help me with the
followings :
we ( central european origination , london office ) might start talking to two
aluminium companies in central europe . before we were to meet them , it would
be rather useful ( i suppose ) to find out what aluminium deals ( if any ) you
closed in the states . the most important issue would be whether you managed
to index the price of power to the price of aluminium ; if yes , how .
your help would be much appreacited .
many thanks ,
jozsef
