Subject: aga forecast for 7 / 21 is 42
vince & stinson ,
the number comes out from the time series model is 42 , compared with mike ' s
61 .
last year ' s number ( true ) was 41 ( 7 / 23 / 99 ) , and 26 ( 7 / 30 / 99 ) . therefore the
curve is down - sloping dramatically .
let us see what happen tomorrow .
