hi julie :
the march invoice # 000166 was sent to our accounting department for
payment on march 28 th . i have a call into them to see what happened to
it . i will let you know .
the aud 5000 invoice was sent to the accounting department but they
sent it back saying they cannot pay invoices in foreign currency . so i then
had to send it to the treasury dept . i will check on it today also .
as far as the other invoice . it should be sent to our australia office to
the
attention of paul quilkey . we had agreed to split this with them . their
address is :
paul quilkey
