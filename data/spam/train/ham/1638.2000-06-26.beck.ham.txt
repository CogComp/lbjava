Subject: re : var for credit trading
ted
thanks for the note - coming from jpmorgan i understand the importance of var
as a key control measure and i appreciate that we may all need to do further
work to ' institutionalise ' a var culture in enron . however , in this instance ,
i believe the initial comment has been taken out of context .
i believe there is a general communication issue here . since inception the
business has been monitoring risk via the use of a cumulative sensitivity
measure for the portfolio - expressed and reported as dvolon the daily dpr .
however , no - one in rac / commercial / commercial support appears to have formally
equated that sensitivity to the business var limit during the longer than
expected delay to the completion of a signed off var model . ( informally this
is being done )
i would have expected the business to utilise a crude ( and possibly
necessarily overstated ) scaling factor based on the volatility of credit
spread movements in the market and for rac to have signed off this scaling
factor . bryan seyfield and david wall will propose this immediately .
finally , i believe both commercial and commercial support for credit trading
are reprioritising the work being completed for the model for var reporting
- we should communicate the new delivery date as soon as possible .
i look forward to discussing this and other rac / commercial support interface
issues with you next week
regards
mike

please see the attached comment at the bottom of this string of e - mails .
the privilege of using enron ' s balance sheet comes with the responsibility to
adequately report the risk in the form that has been agreed to .
it is appalling to me that we are currently incapable of calculating var in a
product that has been approved for trading for several months . it is equally
appalling that the support staff continues to be so unaware of the importance
of this that the comments below could even be considered reasonable .
obviously , the individual who made the comment is hardly responsible . it
lies with both commercial and commercial support management . i know that
airing this out in such a broad way appears to be harsh . this is not the
point . this is not an isolated problem . it is not just pertaining to
europe . please do not feel singled out . but the scrutiny and pressure on var
as a measure of risk continues to grow at fast pace . we can hardly make any
progress if this is the pervasive attitude . let ' s knock this stuff out one
at a time .

the var engine for credit trading is being built by research in london and it
is intended that var be run daily as soon as they have produced / signed off on
this .

my view : prove its insignificant by calculating it every day , that ' s why the
board approved the limit .

hi chris
i talked with david yesterday and we don ' t think the risk is significant
enough to start calculating a var number . however if you have any queries
feel free to give him a call .
