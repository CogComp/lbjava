there will be a story in tomorrow ' s financial times about our trading position in europe . myself and john sherriff spoke with london - based ft reporter andy taylor .
andy is a long - standing contact and an enron supporter . he spoke with various players in the european market and although they were supportive , they were also giving the impression that business with enron had dropped 90 % .
this is not the case and it was therefore important to refute this . i ' m comfortable with how the interview went . john made a point of saying how supportive counterparties had been and we did not discuss anything beyond our european trading position .
will forward the coverage tomorrow .
hope all is well and that you had an enjoyable thanksgiving .
cheers
