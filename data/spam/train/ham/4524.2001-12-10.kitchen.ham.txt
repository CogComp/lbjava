Subject: ena estate meeting
louise ,
as i mentioned yesterday , i would like to have a meeting with all the ena estate troops some time mid to late morning today . prior to that meeting , i believe that it is important for someone to have spoken with ed . also , it would be great if you could be at the meeting ( at least at the beginning ) to , in a sense , toss me the " hot " potato . i need to send out an email and wanted to know if you have a preference for the time ?
thanks ,
don
