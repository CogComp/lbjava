happy new year louise . hope things are going okay down in houston with the bidding process for netco . etc . , and that you were able to take some holiday . i want to thank you again for facilitating my transfer back to canada . i was really enjoying working in the toronto office ; the people are impressive and the opportunity in the ontario market is definitely massive and exciting .
for now , i ' m going to be working on the ' estate ' side of things for enron canada , but meanwhile , i ' ve also started investigating some interesting opportunities outside ( i . e . retail opportunities , online platforms , etc . ) .
anyway , per below , are you okay with enrondirect . co . uk getting transferred over to centrica ?
please let me know when you get a chance . all the london it guys that were dealing with this appear to be gone , so i ' ll follow up as appropriate .
thanks ,
paul

centrica are not connected to txu ( aka eastern group ) to my knowledge . at least as of october when i left london , they were competitors in the marketplace .

is centrica somehow related to txu uk limited ? i seem to remember that they were granted a license to use the name enrondirect for 6 months in connection with a sale of enron direct ( uk ) .

i think that is a good idea . louise should be able to tell you if she still has interest in the name .

mark ( and mark ) - happy new year , i hope you are doing well . could one of you get back to josh bourne at register . com about this ? register . com has been helping us manage our corporate suite of domain names . my assumption is that provided the acquisition of enron direct ( uk ) by centrica plc has been finalized , we should allow the domain name transfer to occur ( though only for enrondirect . co . uk as opposed to enrondirect . ca , enrondirect . com , or other enron direct urls ) . will leave it to you to decide next steps . . .
thanks ,

dear friends ,
i realize that some of you may no longer be at enron . i am very sorry about
what has happened and wish you all the best for a pleasant and productive
2002 . i need to make you aware of a situation that makes me very nervous .
we have been contacted by nominet , the registry for . uk domains . nominet
has asked us to free the domain enrondirect . co . uk and allow it to transfer
away to a third party : centrica plc
please advise whether we should follow these instructions at your earliest
( most urgent ) opportunity .
furthermore , if you have a moment , call me in order to sort out some open
domain matters .
best regards ,
josh
