subject : real options openings ?
dear vince kaminski ,
i was auditing prof dyer ' s real options class on thursday when you spoke
on enron ' s activities in this area . i would be interested in exploring the
possibility of joining the group that works on real options in response to
and in anticipation of enron ' s business requirements . i ' m currently
working in the development and application of real options methodology at
schlumberger . in particular i ' ll be speaking at an industry real options
valuation conference in london ( http : / / www . iqpc . co . uk / finance / rov / ) and i
just had the paper accepted for publication in operations research . could
you pass my resume on to the relevant people to have a look at ?
thanks in advance ,
chris kenyon
