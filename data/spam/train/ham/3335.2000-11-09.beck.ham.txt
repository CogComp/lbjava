as discussed , given joe ' s comments below , a note to confirm that this being
dealt with internally .
rob soeldner has made it clear to joe that :
enron places great importance on trading controls . these are non - negotiatable .
the suggested course of action is not an option
we aren ' t seeking to close any of the agency offices given implemetation of
these controls .
joe is not in yet - rob will be discussing with him further when the us gets
in .
of note - joe is on the commercial side , marcelo parra who is responsible
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made .
regards
andy

as a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable . we need to
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned .
either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of
the people which i do not believe makes any sense at all .
