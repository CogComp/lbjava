Subject: japanese power market
thank you for letting me read our market overview and business model for
japan .
when i went to the exotic energy derivatives conference in december , i met
masayuki fujita , who studies the japanese power market for the mitsubishi
research institute . we chatted about deregulation of the industry and about
the entry of foreign companies into the market .
the japanese understand the need to deregulate the industry , but want to
avoid the pain that may be associated with it . this process is very
unfamiliar and uncomfortable for the japanese . they see power as a matter of
national security ( like agriculture ) , so foreign entrants into the market
will have to tread with care , understanding , and sophistication .
fujita is working on a report for the institute . he has agreed to let me
have copies of the non - confidential portions when it is finished . in the
interim , he sent me a copy of a presentation that i thought you might find
interesting .
regards ,
eugenio
