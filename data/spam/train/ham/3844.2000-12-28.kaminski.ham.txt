Subject: re : eol wti historical trade simulation
stinson ,
thanks a lot for so much work you have done for the simulation model .
it seems that our work will make an impact on eol trading , that is very
exciting .
could you e - mail me the spreadsheet model so that i can catch up with
the changes you have made ?
i read a few books during this vocation . especially a stochastic processes
book , i finished the entire book . the queueing theory is very fascinating ,
and hopefully we can apply the theory to a real ebs project .
i will take my family out to see the nature bridge caverns near san antonio
tomorrow .
see you on tuesday .
happy new year !
zimin

greg ,
here are results corrected for spread profit per round - trip transaction .
prior results incorrectly counted a spread profit per trade .
