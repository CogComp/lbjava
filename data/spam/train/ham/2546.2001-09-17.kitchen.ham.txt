so the scoop is he is average .
he recently moved out of bandwidth 6 weeks ago and back into continental power trading - why he is moving again after 6 weeks . is it a problem with the business or him ?
he worked for marcello romano ( head of bandwidth trading in europe ) as john knows . marcello says he is a solid hard worker who has no edge . if marcello were to run uk gas again he wouldn ' t take him - as he is not sharp . so he wouldn ' t bother to move him across the atlantic if it costs a lot .
your call . ring marcello for more information .

louise - do you know this gentleman from your days in london ? his resume looks good and he is interested in moving to houston and working in east power .
john suarez - you are going to need at least one and probably two solid cash / term traders for the se region . talk to seresh about this guy .
