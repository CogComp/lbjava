title : high natural gas prices affect us oil demand and supply

north america natural gas prices have increased nearly threefold in a year .
gas
has lost market share to the heavy end of the barrel , residual fuel , but it
also to middle distillates .
* cera estimates that the curtailment of gas supplies to interruptable
customers , combined with economically driven switching , accounts for as much
as 0 . 55 mbd of the strong year - on - year increase in us oil demand in january .
* for the short term , high gas prices are having a less pronounced effect on
the oil supply side in the united states , about 0 . 2 mbd .
* this spring about 0 . 1 mbd of the gains in oil demand due to switching should
be yielded back to gas .
* * end * *
