Subject: beaver creek
i just thought i ' d drop a note about the trip . i think it was the best enron offsite i have attended . i thought the focus on interacting was very good and worked better than past golfing events and vegas trips . the event was also very well organized and the host / hostess were excellent .
thank you .
cheers
