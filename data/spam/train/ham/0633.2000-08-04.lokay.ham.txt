please note the following request by richardson to suspend another month of
their contract for the month of august . we will have to account for this
contract suspension in the august forecast with an estimated loss of
$ 116 , 203 . 500 ( 35 , 700 mm / d * 31 days * $ . 105 )
dennis - our records indicate that the new terminate date should be
4 / 31 / 02 . let ' s discuss if you need some documentation to make the system
reflect this termination date . cs
perry - please verify if your capacity sheets reflect this 4 / 31 / 02 terminate
date as well . thanks .
