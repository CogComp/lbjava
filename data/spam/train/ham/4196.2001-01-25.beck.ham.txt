on january 12 , i hosted a brainstorming session at the four seasons hotel in
downtown houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid and
back office services we could offer to the commodity industry . to complete a
plan for launching this strategic commercial venture , we are hosting an
integrated design session facilitated by cap gemini ernst & young ( cgey ) at
their accelerated solutions environment in dallas , texas .
i am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this design
session . this is a critical two - day event to be held february 12 th and 13 th
in dallas , texas . this work session is based on a unique approach called a
designshop  v . it is a very focused , activity - driven event that is composed of
various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups . if you
have not attended one of the designshops related to sap , you will likely
regard this session as different from any working session you have previously
experienced . the prior designshops held in conjunction with sap have proven
to be very successful . therefore , we have elected to utilize this same
methodology on this very critical and strategic venture .
a limited number of representatives from enron will be attending . you were
selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in the
designshop . you are being asked to participate in the full two days with as
little distraction or interruption as possible . the quality of our results
depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the
entire event . additionally , you will be relied on in the future to support
and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session .
this date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods so
that your participation can be maximized . therefore , please make all
necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during
these two days .
please review the attached information regarding hotel , flight information ,
and transportation . preliminary information as to schedule and environment
has also been included . you may direct any additional questions concerning
the event to mary solmonson at ( 713 ) - 853 - 6079 .
i hope that you will be able to participate . please confirm your attendance
for the two days with marvia jefferson at 713 - 853 - 9165 by january 29 th 5 : 00
p . m . if you are unable to attend , it may be appropriate to select someone
else to participate . please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to
take your place until you and i have discussed this .
i thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing you
in dallas !
