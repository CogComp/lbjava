Subject: stinson gibner & hector campos
ken lay gave a high profile presentation on the current natural gas supply
and price situation at a recent conference held by the interstate oil and gas
compact commission , and some of the best graphs came from work that stinson
and hector did ( see the attached , slides # 11 , # 12 , # 14 , & # 15 ) .
i really appreciate their research and hope to be able to use their talents
again for presentations for the office of the chairman . .
