Subject: gtc vs . master
louise ,
the consensus which emerged from the meeting this morning is that the power guys would like to have a full blown master agreement on enrononline instead of a simpler gtc .
obviously , i can put either onto enrononline , but wanted to let you know before we do so .
if you want us to stick with a simple gtc , please let me know .
thanks ,
dave
