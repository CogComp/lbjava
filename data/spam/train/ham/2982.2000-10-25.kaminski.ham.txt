Subject: super saturday changes - update
i am sure that all of you have seen the notice sent this morning from
charlene jackson , managing director of the associate and analyst program . i
wanted to follow up with a note to all campus team mds and it team members to
clarify any confusion surrounding super saturdays and technologist recruiting
for the global technology track . although the global technology track is
part of the analyst and associate program - we will not be participating in
the super saturday events listed below . technologist candidates will be
brought into the office for a friday office visit .
super saturdays were first initiated for commercial analyst and associate
recruiting because many enron representatives were not able to leave their
desks while the market was open during the workday . bringing candidates in
during the weekend works well in this situation because enron representatives
can fully participate in the office visit and candidates can still see the
office .
however , many technology vps have suggested that seeing enron " alive and in
action " during the week would be a high selling point for technologist
candidates . therefore , we have opted to have technology office visits on
fridays . the first three office visits are listed below :
november 10 th
december lst
january 19 th
we will be sending out more detailed information on how you can become more
involved with technology office visits . i apologize for any confusion .
please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments . 3 - 3589 .
thanks ,
ashley
