it was a pleasure to meet you yesterday at enron field and to learn more
about enron producer one . looks like you have a winner . i define that as
solving a producer ' s problem before , sometimes , the producer knows the
magnitude of the problem .
please keep us in mind when you have case study success stories involving
pipe line and gathering systems and measurement issues .
again , all the best to you . if i can help further , please holler .
