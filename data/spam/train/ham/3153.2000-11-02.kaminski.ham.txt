margaret carson is going to join us in the meeting next week with nesbitt .
vince will check with ena to see if they also want to attend . i would also
like to determine if ets and / or nbp would want to send a representative ( s ) ,
although margaret said she would take copious notes for distribution to other
key players as necessary . we should ask nesbitt how he would structure a
deal for multiple clients ( eg . ets , nbp , ena , and maybe el paso ) .
[ we need to remain aware of any " affiliate " issues that may result , and make
certain that we are in complete compliance with the regs . ]
i will wait until after our meeting with nesbitt before deciding if / how to
approach el paso . presumably , if asked to particpate , they would share the
cost and have independent access to any working model that is developed .

john ,
i talked to dale nesbitt . he suggested that the best way to evaluate his
model is to
go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his
company .
our cost is a flat fee of $ 12 , 500 that would be deducted from the purchase
price of $ 55 , 000 ,
in case we buy the software package .
the price of 55 k is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required
level of support .
dale will be in houston next week . i have tentatively invited him to visit
with us on tuesday ,
november 7 , at 3 : 00 p . m . he will adjust if you are busy at this time .
please , let me know what you think .
