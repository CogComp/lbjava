Subject: new version of the eol view database - - important
the e - mail i sent yesterday has an attachment that installs the new version
of the database . it worked well in the four computers we used to test it .
nevertheless , it failed on bob shults ' s computer ( maybe because of a slightly
different configuration of his computer ) . we rewrote the attachment to fix
the problem .
if the attachment gave you trouble , or if you have not launched it yet ,
please use the one below instead .
sorry for the inconvenience ,
eugenio
