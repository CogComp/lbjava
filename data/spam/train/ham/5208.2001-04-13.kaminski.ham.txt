Subject: it support for research weather group
mark ,
first let me say thank you for your assistance in making it possible for
meteorologists tony hamilton and stephen bennett to hit the groung running
this week when they came over to london from houston . when we came into our
offices in houston monday morning , tony and steve had already gathered and
analyzed their data , prepared reports and were ready for the avistar
briefings ! the cross - atlantic communication and data - sharing and manipulation
went seamlessly ! we have great expectations for continued synergy with this
new set - up .
the research weather group is excited about our expanded responsibilities in
london . we are committed to maximizing the value added we can provide to the
weather derivatives , crude & products , uk trading , continental power , and
analytics efforts . we are , however , also extremely dependent on computers
and communication , associated software and peripherals . plus the datastreams
we access and the reports we generate are very time - critical in their value
to traders . we need a very stable environment , with reliable back - up and
24 - hour support to fulfill our commitments to providing the trading operation
with timely , never - fail research and information flows .
so , thanks again , and please do whatever you can to continue this high level
of support by passing this letter of praise and thanks to your team , and show
them our appreciation for your efforts .
