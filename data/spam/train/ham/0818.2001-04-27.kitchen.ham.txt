Subject: review of disposed assets for residual value and / or potential
exposure
louise : attached is an excel file which lists the results of our search for residual assets or old assets with potential exposure . most of the assets on this list are currently being monitored by special assets or energy capital resources . we included these assets on the list because they have not been very visible and we wanted to make sure that you were aware of their existence . however , also included on the list are 3 to 4 transactions similar to midwest gas storage in that it appears that they have not been on anyone ' s radar screen . the scope of our review did not include any former enron international assets now managed by wholesale through the global assets group .
our list is divided into 3 parts : 1 ) retained assets , 2 ) bankruptcy / guarantor claims , 3 ) transactions requiring legal documentation / closure . the bankruptcy / guarantor list is not an all inclusive list of bankruptcies for wholesale but includes those merchant portfolio bankruptcies with a low probability of recovery which are , of course , not a high priority for legal . we just want to make sure they don ' t completely disappear from our scrutiny . you will also note that there are a couple of assets that require further review and we will advise you when we make a final determination .
finally , we will take steps to include these assets in future portfolio reporting so that they can be closely monitored .
many thanks to dick lydecker ' s group and legal for their assistance to rac in reviewing numerous disposed assets that resulted in this list . please call if you have questions . regards ! rick c .
