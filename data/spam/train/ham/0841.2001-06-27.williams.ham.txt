i wanted to commend the real time group for their efforts . for the past 6 month , i ' ve noticed a dramatic difference in the accuracy of deal entry in enpower . accordingly , by the end of the day when i have to route , it has made my job that much easier . in the past it would take hours to figure out what deals were entered incorrectly . now it is very rare that our position manager is off and this makes everyone ' s lives better !
keep up the great work guys ! ! ! !
