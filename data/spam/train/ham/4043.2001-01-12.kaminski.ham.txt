dear mr . zadorozhny :
maxim philippov suggested that i write you . being a first - year mba student
at owen graduate school of management ( vanderbilt university ) with a finance
concentration , i am looking for a summer associate position at enron .
the area of my particular interest is enron ' s risk management products
( commodity derivatives research and trading ) . graduating from novosibirsk
state university with major in physics , i am eager to apply my experience
with the use of theoretical and statistical physics techniques to the
managing of modeling processes and creating complex financial and trading
models . i strongly believe that my graduate education coupled with
undergraduate background in physics , solid work experience in finance and
proven entrepreneurial spirit will allow me to contribute to enron as a
summer associate .

p . s . looking through an example of margin risk hedging at enron ' s web site ,
i think i found a small mistake there . url of this page is
( producer
application )
the second sentence of the paragraph beginning with " paradigm and enron
exchange . . . "
states the following .
for example , if the actual margin is $ 1 . 25 / mmbtu for a given month , then
paradigm will pay enron $ 0 . 13 / mmbtu . alternatively , if the actual margin is
$ 2 . 00 / mmbtu , then enron will pay paradigm $ 0 . 62 / mmbtu .
i believe , if i am reading it correctly , the money should flow in the
opposite direction , namely :
for example , if the actual margin is $ 1 . 25 / mmbtu for a given month , then
enron will pay paradigm $ 0 . 13 / mmbtu . alternatively , if the actual margin is
$ 2 . 00 / mmbtu , then paradigm will pay enron $ 0 . 62 / mmbtu .
am i right ?
again , thank you very much for your time .
