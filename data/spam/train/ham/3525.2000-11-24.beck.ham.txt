Subject: re : debt trading losses
sally , brent and gary ,
in a meeting with bryan , jeff , gary and markus on monday , november 20 th , i
showed bryan a copy of the monthly price verification procedures and the book
administrator ' s price verification comparison spreadsheet . i also showed
brent this information later in the day , as he had to leave before we all
left .
therefore , i find bryan ' s operations ' bullet wrong and misleading . this is
not the statement that was made and agreed to on monday when we all met .
this statement is also not consistent with what is actually in the
attachment . you will receive a copy of the price verifcation spreadsheet for
the last six months on monday .
please call me or theresa with questions .

bryan ,
i think the second bullet is misleading . the bullet is not reflective of
what is actually stated in the attached document .
there is a month - end price verification process on the credit book .
trader pricing is compared to prime broker pricing . where the mark is
greater that 2 points , the difference is discussed with the trader . trader
must then amend the mark or provide third party substantiation for the
illiquid position .
the price verifiaction comparison spreadsheet with broker quotes is filed and
maintained by risk management .
the operations break - down in the process relates to :
triplets excluded from the monthly price verification process and not
escalated , prioritized to management
telewest pricing relied on a price from the prime broker which was manually
sourced and not current
price verification comparison results should be formalized and distributed
to senior management .
thanks . sheila

subject : debt trading losses
we have discovered two positions in the debt trading book which were not
being marked to market . the current mark of the 2 positions results in
approximately $ 4 . 7 million loss . the details are in :
the primary control issues are :
? trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had
not moved over the term of the transactions ( ql ' 00 - nov 15 th )
the losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by
operations . the trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will
implement the steps agreed with operations to ensure that we have a robust
approach to controls for the debt trading book going forward .
