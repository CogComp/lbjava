hi again ,
thanks for the financial data on enron ' s european counterparties .
it is my understanding that you started out with a list of 500 such
counterparties . however , your spreadsheet only contains information for 72
of these european counterparties .
will you please tell me the logic behind the elimination of the 400 + other
counterparties ?
thanks so much ,
iris

hi iris
the inputs and outputs generated by riskcalc can be seen in the attached file :
>
we only looked at the 5 - yr pd .
inputs are in columns a - u . these are the inputs generated by amadeus . you can
run these inputs through the riskcalc model over the web
( http : / / www . moodysqra . com / privfirm ) using the login : dupred , password :
detective . this is our trial licence which lasts for about 2 more weeks ( mike
mumford will have more details about the current licence )
tomas valnek was getting the data from the amadeus database , so i ' ll leave it
to him to determine if houston access is possible . in the meantime you can
use the dataset attached for testing purposes .

hi ben ,
how are you ? today we had a meeting with craig chaney and jeff kinneman to
discuss the private firm model .
they requested that i spend some time carefully analyzing the moody ' s
riskcalc model . i noticed that you also have been looking at riskcalc - as
indicated in your paper entitled " pricing parent companies and their
subsidiaries : model description and data requirements "
other than the example discussed in your paper , did generate any other test
statistics , scores , etc .
also , you stated that you used amadeus database . we are in the process of
trying to obtain data from various data vendors - but that may take a while .
in the mean time , may we have access to the amadeus database or some sample
dataset ?
thanks so much ,
iris
