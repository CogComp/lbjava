louise ,
i am in town and would like to meet up with you when you get a chance but have a hot question for you .
we have a new steel trade in london that is a back to back where we make $ 100 , 000 . it has us issuing an lc but we will be receiving an lc from the purchasers . note we will get the lc from the purchaser prior to us posting an lc to the producer . if we need to post cash we can discount the lc from the purchaser to post cash .
i think this meets the objectives but want to check with you .
thanks and i will set up a time on your schedule .
regards
bruce
