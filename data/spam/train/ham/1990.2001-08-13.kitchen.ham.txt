don : thanks for you quick and professional follow up to my
confidential request about whether enron ' s eeos group might be available for
some form of business combination . i have notified mr . joseph p . lahey , my
client with the lahey group , of your response . he has requested that i ask
you to ask mr . stanley if we could meet anyway , some time during late august
or early september , in that we might like to discuss a possible joint
venture between lahey group and enron eeos , whereby enron eeos would
fullfill certain aspects of lahey group domestic projects . once again
thanks for your assistance in advance . cliff mcfarland , president ,
