republic that crashed in queens new york , usa . banked
with us here and had a balance of ( us $ 35 . 5 m } which the
bank now expects a next of kin to claim as
beneficiary ,
valuable efforts are being made in my bank to get in
touch with any of the pule ' s family or relatives but
to no success .
it is because of the perceived possibility of not
being able to locate any of late engr , john pule next
of kin { he had no wife nor children that is known to
us } . the management under the influence of i and
members of the board of directors , are making
arrangement for the funds to be declared .
