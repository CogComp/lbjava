Subject: paul , i ' ve got what you are looking for
hi , paul , how are you going these days ? it is tough to find what you are looking for ; fortunately , i got them with help of my tutor ' s friend . i ' ll post them to you this weekend but you must treat me when i go to boston next time .
do you remember yamamoto ? the pretty designer from tokyo , who accompany me to your place last year , i saw a few chinese handicrafts , embroideries in her place a couple of days ago , which she bought occasionally in china at the time of traveling . these fantastic embroideries attracted me immediately . they are too beautiful to describe in words . i ordered embroidery ' cat ' on the internet under highly recommends by yamamoto . it looks so incredible and vivid that i believe embroidery is the top grade collection and decoration .
are you planning to add some east elements to your designs ? i think these embroideries are the best choices .
this is the website i ordered embroideries : http : / / www . dufe - emba . com / works . htm you may see if anything you can use . the price of embroideries is higher ; it seems not made in china but france .
