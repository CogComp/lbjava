Subject: important : verify your account
security measures - are you traveling ?
paypal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community
of buyers and sellers . to protect the security of your account , paypal
employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our
anti - fraud teams regularly screen the paypal system for unusual
activity .
we recently noted one or more attempts to log in to your account from a
foreign country . if you accessed your account while traveling , the
attempt ( s ) may have been initiated by you .
because the behavior was unusual for your account , we would like to take
an extra step to ensure your security and you will now be taken through
a series of identity verification pages .
