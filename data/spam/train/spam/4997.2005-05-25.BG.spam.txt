vinoble , inc . ( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and
acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland
security , security information systems , and other security services to
provide long term growth for its shareholders .
vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in
the security sector is unprecedented .
the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have
changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both
physical
and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments ,
especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the
focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security
services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of
forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products
and
services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2 oo 5 .
vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security
market by delivering professional services , security products , security
training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective ,
vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals
offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s
consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will
help
organizations protect key assets including persons , property ,
information ,
brand , and reputation .
homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the
healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) ,
sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued
increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble
intends
to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical
and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients ,
alliance
partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are
the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious
provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of
each
client .
management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( " gccc " ) to assist
in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such
acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at
present ,
vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential
acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and
audits , the
company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis
required for listing on a national exchange .
here is recent news on the company :
malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 2 o , 20 o 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb :
vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth
opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information
systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it
continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition
of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps
tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional
businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software ,
and patents .
following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification )
technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use
applications , the company has concluded that the need for application
support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the
framework which operates such technology . the company has identified
several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software ,
and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element .
middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both
internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves
routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into
different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web
services and service - oriented architectures .
since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and
non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling
customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important
in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with
customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of
assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the
manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will
enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to
shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply
chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid
and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system .
the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology
will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing
rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide
critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of
businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and
assets in this current state of constant threat .
