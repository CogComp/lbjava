profile
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
us biotec , inc . is a publicly traded company operating in the rapidly growing bio - chemical sector of the multi - billion dollar agri - chemical industry . the company ' s common stock trades under the ticker symbol usbo . pk . us biotec ( usbo ) was established to profitably develop , manufacture , market and distribute bio - degradable , non - toxic and non - carcinogenic products to agriculture , the commercial turf industry , forestry , golf courses , professional landscapers , nurseries and mass market retail lawn and garden markets . the company ' s products are designed to rehabilitate and protect soils and plants through all natural , environmentally friendly alternatives to toxic fertilizers .
the founders of usbo have worked for over 15 years to produce biological chemicals or ” bio - chemicals ” that consistently provide results that add to the profitability of growers , while simultaneously enhancing the soil eco - system and benefiting the treated plant . the products the company has developed offer a better way to care for your crop , lawn , garden , house plants , flowers and most significantly , the environment .
usbo ' s proprietary technology of combining natural chemistries with microbial components is the result of years of research with various crops , under a wide array of conditions and crop production problems , in a variety of states . as a result of this effort of product development and on - going refinement , usbo ' s products are state - of - the - art in their ease of application and product performance . in test markets , the company ' s products have proven to stimulate plant growth and / or increase yield by 10 % to 30 % , depending on the species treated and prevailing environmental conditions .
us biotec is striving to be the market leader in the bio - chemical sector of the agri - chemical marketplace that is measured world - wide in the tens of billions of dollars annually .
us biotec has developed a full line of biodegradable , non - toxic and non - carcinogenic products for the agricultural , forestry , commercial turf , golf course , professional landscaping and mass retail lawn and garden markets . us biotec ' s ecologically friendly products can replace many of the toxic pesticides and caustic fertilizers commonly used in the agricultural industry . a second advantage beyond being environmentally friendly is that the company ' s field studies conducted in four test markets since 1991 indicate that us biotec ' s products can stimulate plant growth and increase vegetable crop yield by 10 % to 30 % depending on the crop and environmental conditions . us biotec plans to hire a third party to conduct independent tests to determine the precise impact the company ' s products have on
crop yield .
by altering the concentration of natural components , such as phosphorlating compounds , enzymes , amino acids , minerals , carbohydrates , vitamins and microbes in each product , us biotec can custom design a compound for use on specific crop production problems . for example , some of us biotec ' s products are designed to stimulate root growth and another may promote leaf growth , while another can enhance fruiting buds and yet a different product can help alleviate seasonal water stress . the different primary functions of these biotech products are achieved by altering the ratio and concentration of the common components .
us biotec believes that biochemical technology could revolutionize the way food is grown ! usbo ' s products stimulate healthier plants that produce higher quantities of crops , and the company ' s soil products help correct many microbial and mineral problems present in soils today . plus , us biotec ' s soil biostimulants help to rehabilitate the soil ecosystem by breaking down the residual build - up of toxic insecticides , herbicides , fungicides and synthetic fertilizers , thus promoting the restoration of soil to its natural , pre - polluted state . equally as important is the fact that the company believes these biotech products are economically feasible for the majority of produce growers to purchase considering their current commodity prices .
us biotec ' s products are formulated with bio - chemical components and this bio - chemical technology is not related to genetic engineering technology . us biotec ' s biostimulants do not influence a seed ' s gene function , but work instead to stimulate vegetative plant growth , promote fruiting sites and enhance the plant ' s immune system function against natural enemies after germination . although , it is logical that healthier plants will produce all - around healthier seeds .
us biotec has already completed its research and development phase , and has formulated approximately thirty products that it believes to be commercially viable . usbo is planning to launch all of its agricultural products in the spring of 2005 , and currently plans to launch all of its existing products within 36 months of january 2005 .

strategy
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
us biotec ’ s mission is to establish itself as a profitable industry leader , pioneering the development , manufacturing , marketing and distribution of bio - degradable , non - toxic and non - carcinogenic products to the agriculture , forest , commercial turf , golf course , professional landscaping and commercial nursery industries as well as to the mass market retail lawn and garden market .
us biotec believes it already has a very distinct advantage over its competition because it currently has approximately 30 practical , environmentally friendly bio - chemical products ready to be introduced in various existing markets . usbo is in the process of launching its agricultural products by july 2005 . the company ’ s strategic plan is as follows :

growth strategy
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
it is the ultimate goal of us biotec ’ s management team to effectively build up the company to sustained profitability while providing shareholders with competitive returns on equity . us biotec may also choose to utilize an aggressive acquisition strategy to consolidate the highly fragmented and immature bio - chemicals industry . continued funding of research development will provide two exceptional products that are some 24 - 30 months from mass marketing status .
/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
diversification strategy
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
as us biotec builds its brand name , product recognition , distribution network and reputation as the industry leader in the environmentally friendly bio - chemical solutions market , the company will simultaneously seek out other eco - friendly products to distribute .
as part of its growth strategy through strategic alliances , us biotec intends to distribute complementary products manufactured by other companies to applicable markets . usbo ’ s policy is to stay current with new products and technologies wherever and whenever reasonable and profitable . still , as the company comes across smaller companies that lack distribution capabilities or capital to market their products , but have redeeming products that are ready for market , usbo may form strategic alliances that draw upon the company ’ s distribution capability to increase revenues through these third party distribution agreements .

marketing and sales strategy
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
us biotec understands that providing revolutionary products is not enough to guarantee the company ’ s financial success . this is why usbo has designed a detailed marketing and sales strategy that takes into account the unique characteristics of how the agri - chemical industry , the retail lawn and garden industry , the golf course industry , etc . operate . the company ’ s marketing and sales strategy may potentially include the use of teams of independent manufacturer ’ s representatives ( reps ) . each division picks only the best reps that possess both expertise in the science of our products and strong , established relationships with the particular customers and markets they will be targeting .
sales representatives in the agriculture and commercial markets will be closely supported by us biotec ’ s highly trained in - house technical sales representatives ( tsr ) . these tsrs will be available to provide situational analysis , product recommendations and ongoing training , plus information to the teams of reps , dealer sales organizations and customers .
the marketing of lawn and garden products will be given to an experienced professional rep group or by hiring an experienced professional mass market guru .
