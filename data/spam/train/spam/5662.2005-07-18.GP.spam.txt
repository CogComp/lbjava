are you tired of public companies without anything substantial backing their story - how about a revolutionary invention that will change the security industry forever , and the company just went public ! ! !
company name : sniffex inc
ticker : snfx
we profiled this stoc - k 1 month ago when it was at $ 1 and we said dont buy unless you are long term player , we projected $ 5 - 10 should be seen soon and since then the stoc - k went to $ 3 . 4 high and is now steadily trading like $ 500 k or more every day at $ 2 . 80 range .
the company has the most sensitive explosive detection device in the world and now after what happened in london 10 days ago this sector is the hottest on the stoc - k market .
we believe sniffex will start selling their devices very soon to all security forces around the world simply because their device can find even 100 grams of almost any type of explosive from 30 - 50 yards maybe even more and even through walls or metal shield .
we strongly believe once everybody on the stoc - k market realize what a gem snfx then its possible for this stoc - k to see $ 10 - 20 levels .
rating : strong buy

reason for the top 2005 rating : unique explosive detection device capable of finding its targets from tens or hundreds of meters ! ! ! there is no other eds device which is so powerful that can locate almost any explosive behind concrete walls from distance of tens of meters ! !
the competition : there are many companies in the industry of sniffing explosives , some of them are public and they are companies like ison hwpr or hiet and all of them have devices which can locate explosive from 10 inches , 1 feet , 2 feet or close to that .
compared to these results sn fx device is tens of times better and smaller in size and yet cheaper ! !
snfx announced the release of sniffex version 1 . 1 , a handheld explosives detection device which the company claims can locate nitro - based explosives from a distance of 10 to 100 feet depending on the quantity of the explosive and environmental conditions .
the company also stated that , to the best of their knowledge , sniffex is the first device of its kind that can operate from such distances and find exp losives behind barriers .
