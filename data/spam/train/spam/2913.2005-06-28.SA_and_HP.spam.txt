i have also created a very elaborate spreadsheet where i am tracking my activities . i keep one page which tracks my trading history . this is only for trades which have completed from start to finish . to date , i have completed 19 trades for an overall profit of $ 15 , 925 . 00 , at an average 77 percent roi . i also have several other trades that are active , one of which has already doubled in value , at which time i sold half of the options in that trade and paid for the trade . it is now a ' free ' trade . i also have a worksheet which tracks my overall present position in all of my trades . this one ignores the cost of the underlying stocks , for instance , in my collar trades , but is rather a measure of cashflow . my current ytd total is over $ 33 k . . .

keeping a close eye on netflix over the last couple of months i sold long term short puts out of the money when the stock indicated oversold conditions . as the stock bounced back and showed over bought signals i offloaded the puts and sold calls against my stock . last month netflix options alone made me over $ 3 , 000 . opening up the wealthbuilder a few weeks ago i saw a recommendation for a call calendar . at the time i wanted to enter a credit trade instead of a debit trade and entered a bear call based on technical indicators . all options expired worthless and i pocketed the entire credit . this month i placed some covered calls and bull puts on taser as it rocketed up . i closed all positions after 10 days with a $ 1500 profit . many companies proudly advertise big percentage gains . many times i ' ve asked those companies if those big gains hide big losses - all with the exception of sts was hiding big losing trades . my record this year is 14 out of the 18 stocks i ' ve traded have made money . it ' s not the 49 out of 50 that fasi and greg get but with each month i refine my system and keep closing the gap . the education sts provides is invaluable . without it my approach would have been that of a gambler . with it my approach is systematic and disciplined and consistently profitable .
