parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in
his closet !
does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) .
and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods -
new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried
beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old
sons closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when
she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties ,
fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles .
" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank " , says the 41 - year - old
woman , " there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my
husband earns in a year " .
the woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where
he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away
and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . little did
they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than
actually finding it in the closet .
as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e - mail , a type of
" report " to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday
after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom .
" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the heck , i put my name
on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out " , says the clever
15 - year - old .
the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one
$ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top
and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to
the top of the list .
the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand
dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5 - address list . " i get junk e - mail all the time , and
really did not think it was going to work " , the boy continues .
within the first few days of sending out the e - mail , the post office box
that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions
began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills .
" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box
had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a
yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i
was in trouble or something ( laughs ) " . he goes on , " i went up to the
counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all " . over
the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . " the
money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the
closet , barely had time for my homework " . he had also been riding his bike
to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties ,
fifties and hundreds .
" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks
with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the
lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the
money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a
really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me
and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next
bank down the street ( laughs ) . " surprisingly , the boy did not have any
reason to be afraid . the reporting news
team examined and investigated the so - called " chain - letter " the boy was
sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was
completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 ,
section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in
the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which
state a product or service must be exchanged for money received .
every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read ,
" please send me report number xyx " . this simple note made the letter
legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a
five - dollar fee .
[ this is the end of the media release . if you would like to understand how
the system works and get your $ 71 , 000 - please continue reading . what
appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -
you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions ] .
be financially free like others within a year ! ! ! before you
say " bull " , please read the following . this is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the
internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire
show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really
can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the
program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are
" absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if
people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some
megabucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost " .
due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this
program has attained , it is currently working better
than ever .
note * follow the directons below , i had best results the second time when
i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions .
in order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so
that the returns are many . i have been extremely successful using the
following company . they send out the offers , and all i do is accept money
for reports , then i send back to the people as soon as possible .
this is what one had to say : " thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was
approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad i
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received total
$ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in " .
pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey .
here is another testimonial : " this program has been around for a long time
but i never believed in it . but one day when i received this again in the
mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the simple instructions
and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money started to come in . first month i
only made $ 240 . 00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of
$ 290 , 000 . 00 . so far , in the past 8 months by re - entering the program , i
have made over $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again . the key to

your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you
with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk
e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much
more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going :
method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally
let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will
assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % response ( the response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % . also many people
will send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each ) .
continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails .
with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10
people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 50 , 000 .
out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that equals
100 people responded and ordered report # 2 .
those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails .
the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 .
those 1000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million
e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 .
those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of
50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000
orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times
$ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half million ) . your total income in this example is :
1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . . . .
grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00
numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out
the worst possible responses and no matter how you
calculate it , you will still make a lot of money !
remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people
ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment
what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people
mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on
the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just
that , and more !
method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet
advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of
free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response .
we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as
you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the
report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all
orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name
and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
receive the report .
= order each report by its number & name only . notes : always
send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not
accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2
sheets of paper or aluminum foil . on one of those sheets of paper , write
the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail
address and your name and postal address .

accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money .
when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving
" junk mail " . i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the
population and percentages involved . i " knew " it wouldn ' t work . jody
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in
with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old
" i told you so " on her when the thing didn ' t work . well , the laugh was on
me ! within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses . within the next 45
days she had received total $ 147 , 200 . 00 . . . . all cash ! i was shocked .
i have joined jody in her " hobby " .

" not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i
wouldn ' t get enough orders to at least get my money back " . " i was
surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with
orders . i made $ 319 , 210 . 00 in the first 12 weeks . the nice thing about
this deal is that it does not matter where people live . there simply isn ' t a
better investment with a faster return and so big " .

" i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i
should have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get
another copy , so i had to wait until i was e - mailed again by someone
else . . . . . . 11 months passed then it luckily came again . . . . . . i did not delete
this one ! i made more than $ 490 , 000 on my first try and all the money
came within 22 weeks " .
