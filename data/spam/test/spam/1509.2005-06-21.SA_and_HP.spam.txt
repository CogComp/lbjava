summer gull - ibility
by kay seefeldt
when island kids are released on the last day of the school , the
euphoria can be felt all the way to the mainland !
summer vacation equals freedom ! a time to be free like the
ever - present , ravenous gulls on outstretched wings keeping a watchful
eye out for unguarded tidbits .
as a kid , the lazy , hazy days of summer seemed to stretch into
infinity . a gift of seventy - five precious days to do as i pleased .
my first mission was to head to the general store , a stone ' s
throw from our house .
with one thin dime the fisherman or fisher - girl got a real
bargain - - a length of green twine on a spool and two shiny black
hooks ( that wouldn ' t be shiny for long ) , one lead sinker , and a
summer of shear pleasure .
between tides , i ' d fit in baseball , tarzan swings , frog hunting ,
marbles , and playing school . high tides found me a few yards from
our house on the end of my deceased grandfather ' s wharf . i ' d be on
the dry end of a fishing line , with a baited hook dangling in the
cold atlantic waters , awaiting the tug of a harbor pollack .
to me , the wharf - - at that time run by my uncle and dad - - was
the most exciting place on our small island community . fishermen
selling their lobster catch , wharf hands scrambling up or down the
ladders , boat engines roaring , gulls squawking overhead , and free
bait for them and me .
on rainy days , men would gather in the small shop . the wood
stove kept every body toasty warm while they told their fish stories .
best of all , a glass case full candy bars offered its sweet contents
in exchange for a nickel .
daddy showed me how to clean the fish and pickle them overnight
in salt brine . by deft use of a blade , i could cut the head off and
gut the fish in one precise movement . the next morning , i ' d match
the fish up by size and tie two together by their tails , or three if
i had an " odd fish out " to hang over the clothesline behind our
house . my fish were organized on the clothesline , smallest to
largest .
then i ' d be ready to catch another batch .
my hands perpetually smelled of fish perfume , enough to make any
tomboy proud .
like a miser , i ' d count my horde every day . if flies were
trying to " blow my fish " , i ' d pepper the gullet openings hoping to
keep them from using my fish as an incubator . these dried fish would
taste mighty good in the cold of winter with mashed potatoes and
cream style corn . some would be summer treats .
occasionally , i ' d discover i had several fish less than the day
before . some of the smallest would be missing . when i mentioned my
loss of fish , my brother said , " probably some hungry gull after a
free meal . "
determined to keep the gulls at bay , i tied several brown paper
bags to the clothes line in strategic locations . but still the
smallest , driest fish continued to disappear .
one afternoon , my tomboy intuition told me to check on my fish
for thieving gulls . there stood the " gull " - - jackknife in hand ,
peeling the skin off the driest of the fish .
" i ' m inspecting these to see if you salted them correctly , " he
informed me as if he were an fda agent .
in my eyes , no matter what my brother did was fine by me . no
matter what he told me , i swallowed his every word - - hook , line and
sinker .
you could say i was the gull - ible one .
and i still am , where my brother is concerned . he is loved as
much today as he was in years gone by , maybe even more , for adding
such colorful memories to my life .

kay lives in maine and enjoys writing stories about her family , many
of which have been published on several on - line ezines . she hopes to
compile these stories into a book for her children and grandchildren .
this story was a gift of words to her brother who celebrated his
birthday on june 7 . by the way , " blowing the fish " means the flies
were laying eggs in them .

dear heartwarmers :
thank you , diane for sharing your lovely story with us . what a
privilege to know and to be related to such a wonderful man !
- - jackie
dear heartwarmers :
i was really blessed with that story . diane ' s grandfather had a
beautiful heart for the lord . most of all she is appreciative of his
gifts to her and her family . it takes a heart to show appreciation
towards the good things one has planted in one ' s heart . diane ,
thanks for being appreciative of grandpa ' s doings in your life . wish
i had such grandpa .
- - george , lagos , nigeria
dear heartwarmers :
wow ! diane ' s story about her grandfather - in - law filled my eyes
with tears and my heart with amazing grace . who can resist that
simple song that is loved and sung by people of all faiths . it was
the comfort after september 11 th , and it is the world ' s most
treasured hymn . it has given me hope when i felt hopeless , and it
always reminds me that this life is but for a moment - - that the only
thing we will ever take with us when we leave this planet , is what
we ' ve given away . in 10 , 000 years the things we count as riches
today will have given way to what we have done for others . well
said , diane , and a fitting tribute for a true man of god .
