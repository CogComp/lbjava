of your country , who used to work with shell oil development company

2002 , my client , his wife and their three children were involved in a
car accident along sagbama express road . all occupants of the
vehicle unfortunately lost their lives . since then i have made
several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients
extended relatives , this has also proved unsuccessful .
after these several unsuccessful attempts , i decided to track his
last name over the internet , to locate any member of his family
hence i contacted you . i havecontacted you to assist in repatriating
the money and properties left behind by my client before they get
confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge
deposit were lodged .
particularly , in the gulf bank plc where the deceased has an account
valued at about us $ 17 . 5 million has issued me a mandate to provide

weeks . since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for
over 3 years now , i seek your consent to present you as the next of
kin of the deceased to have the same last name so that the proceeds
of this account valued at us $ 17 . 5 million can be paid to you and
then you and i can share the money . 60 % to me and 40 % to you . i have
all necessary legal documents that can be used to backup any claim
