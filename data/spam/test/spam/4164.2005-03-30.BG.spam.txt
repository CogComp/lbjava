what could be a more bullish sign for a public company than
its ceo buying back a ton of shares ? very little , and the
fact that the ceo / president of softnet has purchased over
1 million shares of sttc in the open market speaks
volumes about his commitment and belief in the company ' s
prospects . that in turn generally instills confidence
in employees , business partners , analysts , shareholders and
we expect , our readers . but what ’ s his motivation ?
here ’ s what we know . in real estate , it ' s always been
“ location , location , location ! ” in the 1990 s technology
boom , it was “ platform , platform , platform ! ” after the
internet stock bubble burst and the market sorted out the
strong from the weak , things settled down and a new term
gained prominence in technology circles : “ search engine . ” as
yahoo grew and ebay became interactive , tech visionaries
could see that “ engine , engine , engine ! ” was the market ' s
newest money making mantra .
in this millennium , the growth of google and ask jeeves
has proven that a good search engine can be a terrific money
maker for its owners . softnet technology , has its
own proprietary commerce search engine that operates the
innovative wholesalebyus . ( softnet acquired
wholesalebyus ( wbu ) on july 9 , 2004 ) .
as softnet changed its name and trading symbol to meet
its new business model in august of this year , management
chose to retain one of the company ' s best performing
products , instead of selling it off . sttc created a
solutions technology subsidiary that would be solely
dedicated to the company ' s securetime ® biometric
payroll system . that ' s insight - and industry insiders
liked the way softnet handled the transition and retention
of a prime revenue stream .
so , the company now includes a search engine that
internet retailers can use to their benefit and a biometric
id system for securing work areas and producing complete
payroll accuracy … in addition to their present ventures .
softnet is already operating in the restaurant industry
and the casino industry with its securetime ® software ( can
hospitals and hotels be far behind ? ) and the recent
launch of the wholesalebyus web site utilizing the
company ' s proprietary search engine is a clear indicator
that the company is on track , moving ahead , and generating
sales . the aggressive nature of softnet ' s management and
the products softnet has in operation may well warrant
bookmarking their symbol and watching what happens .
solutions technology , inc . ( sti )
offers a customized biometric system as a service that
integrates fingerprint recognition security seamlessly into
virtually any business . the system will dramatically
minimize a company ’ s risks , streamline its processes , track
its resources , and trim its labor costs .
