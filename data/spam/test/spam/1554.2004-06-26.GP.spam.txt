Subject: generic pharmacy 8
dear reader ,
all of our products are exact generic equivalants
of the well known brand name drugs , just like the
ibuprofen you buy at the grocery store is the generic
version of advil . our generic pharmaceuticals are
made in a state - of - the - art laboratory using the exact
same top - grade ingredients as the name brands .
being generic , our products are less expensive
than the brand name equivalants . the reason that you
can buy our products for less is that we dont pay for
branding , marketing , advertising , or a costly sales
force . we pass along those cost savings directly
to you .
we appreciate your business .
sincerely , felipe
