during the war in my country , and following the indiscriminate looting of public and government properties by the rebel forces , the sierra leone mining coop . was one of the target looted and it was destroyed . my father including other top government functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels in november 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian government of ahmed tejan kabbah .
