a
wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for
information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by

* * * why we believe vnbl . ob will give big returns on investment * * *
* at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency
identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors
to
transmit information about a person or object wirelessly .
* vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location
technology .
* vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies
and
governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources . such
technology
has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials
designated " high risk " were they to fall into the wrong hands .
* vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order
to
create " high security space " in locales where it is deemed necessary .
locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea
ports ,
mines , nuclear facilities , and more .
* as with all stoc - ks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has
made
vnbl a hot buy .
news on vnbl
malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2 oo 5 - - vinoble , inc .
( otcbb : vnbl -
news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth
opportunities
in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and
other
security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and
control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in
the
oil & gas and petrochemical industries .
although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they
can
also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in
different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of
specific
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a well filling with water .
as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the
entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is
essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would
enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or
danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives
valuable
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid
can
also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and
chemical
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level .
vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are
more
than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company believes that such offering service and technology
application
in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position
vinoble in
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the
increasing capital and global spending that the company will require
for
growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at
a
cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to
do
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of
constant threat .
this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is
exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly
innovative pioneer . we see big things happening tno this stoc - k .
