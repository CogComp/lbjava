balance as at the end of august 1999 amounting to £ 4 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( four
million five hundred british pounds sterling only ) . since his death my bank
has been expecting a next of kin to stand as beneficiary to these funds but
no one has come has come up . valuable efforts have been made by my
department to locate any of late william barnes relative or his business
partner to stand as beneficiary to his estates but there was no success in
our search .
it is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any
of late william barnes next of kin since his wife and daughter died with him
in the plane crash . consequently , the top boards of directors of my bank are
planning to declare the fund " unclaimed " and transfer it to special trust
fund for purchase of arms and ammunition for soldiers in iraq . in other to
avert this negative development , i now seek your permission to have you

account as the beneficiary and next of kin . i will perfect all documents and
proves to enable us transfer these funds .
i have secured from the probate registry an order of mandamus to locate any
of the late william barnes relative or business partner . i am assuring you

legitimately . once these funds are moved to your nominated account , you will
