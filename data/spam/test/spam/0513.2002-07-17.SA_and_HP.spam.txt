here is what our customers are saying about the temple “ 3 ” ragga dagga ( tm ) phenomenon :
“ to whom it may concern ,
i was skeptical when i first read your ad . i grew up in the 70 ’ s temple 3 , but cheaper , and it is legal ! i also have a lot of trouble sleeping , but the capillaris herba made into tea works and smells great ! your products that i tried so far , are as good or better than your ads say ! that is hard to find nowadays in a company . who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius . i will be a customer for life ! also , i talked with a lady on the phone when i was ordering , and asked her to find out if i could get my products and samples to hand out for free . and just send the customers to you . or get a discount on products that i could sell retail to people . i would prefer the earlier one becau !
se , i can just talk about your products , i am a great salesman ( about 10 years experience ) , i could hand out flyers , give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed , etc . . i am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while , maybe indefinitely ? this deal would give me my own products and samples for free ? you would get free advertising , word of mouth , samples into peoples hands to try , someone that is very good with computers , someone who studied about mail order , internet , cold calling , small business , good with people , etc . . i would like to be doing something , even if i would get on social security disability . it is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys , or do a lot of the things i used to do ! at least i would be able to do something worthwhile . and great products makes it real easy to sell . let me know what you think ?
sincerely ,
