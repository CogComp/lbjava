hi randy , bill .
as per our discussion this afternoon randy ,
enron corp . ( enron ) has deteriorated further in the market place and the
recent downgrade of enron by s & p to bbb , although not completely a surprise ,
is still disconcerting . i applaud enron ' s effort in obtaining additional
bank lines to shore up liquidity but am disappointed that your pipeline
assets had to be pledge in support of same . additionally , moody ' s and s & p
have stated publicly that further downgrade is possible .
i would like to remind you that ngx does not provide any unsecured lines to
entities who are rated below bbb .
as you well know , given ngx ' s size and the fact that ngx needs to keep the
integrity of the exchange intact , we have no option but to inform you of the
following .
accordingly , please be advised that effective immediately enron canada corp
( ecc ) will no longer have any unsecured lines here at ngx ( reference
attached contracting party ' s agreement , schedule c , para 3 . 0 . a ) .
we respectfully request that ecc provide collateral ( preferably irrevocable
letter of credit , else registered interest in cash ) by the close of business
day monday , november 5 , 2001 ( reference contracting party ' s agreement ,
schedule c , para 8 . 1 ) .
as i said , if some other counterparty was in the position you are in right
now , you would expect us to do what it takes to keep the exchange
safe / intact / whole at all times .
please call if you have any questions .
