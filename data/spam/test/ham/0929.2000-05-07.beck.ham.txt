Subject: organizational changes
given the evolution of a number of our businesses , we have decided to make an
organizational change . the change is in response to a number of factors .
first , as a part of our new initiative in enron net works , it is becoming
clear that we have the opportunity to quickly expand enron  , s underlying
business model to other commodity markets . such an expansion requires a
coordinated focus on strategy as we select and develop these opportunities .
second , the success of enrononline and the continued expansion of our
wholesale activities in north america and europe have increased the
coordination requirements across our north american and european operations .
as a result of these two factors , we are making the following organizational
changes effective immediately :
cliff baxter will move from enron north america to enron corp . as executive
vice president and chief strategy officer .
mark frevert will become chairman and ceo of north america , replacing cliff .
in addition , mark will remain chairman of enron europe .
john sherriff will become president and ceo of enron europe .
we are confident that these changes will increase the effectiveness of our
organization . please join us in congratulating cliff , mark and john on their
new responsibilities .
