Subject: fw : middle market customers that denver would like full
responsibility for
louise , further to our conversation of yesterday . . . here is a list ( in order of priority ) that i have reviewed with the denver office . in all cases , if fred ' s group is able to make a case that the cfo truly is the financial contact , then we are prepared to leave as is . . . . otherwise as per mark ' s note , i would like to clarify the marketing role regarding all rockies and san juan producers ( both physical and paper ) and transfer the primary responsibilities back to the denver office as we had always planned .
pls review and advise if you need anything further .
