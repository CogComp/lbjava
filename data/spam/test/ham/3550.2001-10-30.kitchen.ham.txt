subject : scott at wigas confirms the issue is enron
leaving you this message on your vm as well as email - - not sure which will be more accessible . finally got through to scott . he confirms that it is enron - specific , and that the decision is coming from wisconsin energy ' s corporate risk management / credit function . he has been told to stop all trading activity within his purview ( financial derivatives ) ; he ' imagines ' that both physical and financial are involved , although he does not know for certain . the company is taking a wait - and - see attitude ; there is no set timetable for a resumption .
i asked for the name of a contact in their corporate risk management group ( in order to ask for some more parameters regarding the situation ) and was given donna brophy at 414 - 221 - 2749 . scott asked me to give him time to call her for a heads - up that she might be hearing from enron , so i agreed not to call until at least 9 am central . is this a call i should make , or is that not appropriate ? please let me know . thanks .
