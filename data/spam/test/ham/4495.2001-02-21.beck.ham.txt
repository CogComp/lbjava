Subject: website link of outsourcing offsite
the info from the outsourcing offsite has been loaded to the development
environment of the global risk operations home page . take a look . i scanned
and didn ' t see anything i wouldn ' t want to have in production , but thought
you might want to check before we move it into production . once you say
okay , we ' ll move it out and then we need you to send the memo out that
introduces the website .
