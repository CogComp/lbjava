Subject: east power development origination credit allocation
louise :
i got a couple urgent messages today from jody pierce and fred mitro asking about allocation of the group ' s origination .
attached please find our official list ( a copy of which i gave you last week , but i have made a few updates ) .
in making these allocations for purposes of the prc process , however , i want to note a couple of things . first , i have listed the individual in the group who worked most with me on each of the subject transactions . each deal , however , involved many members of the group , and i don ' t want to diminish other ' s contributions to these deals . the deals we have closed have been very complicated , and have all involved many months of structuring in order to bring them to the point of creating value for the company .
second , the deal sheet does not recognize the significant development milestones we have reached with respect to florida and georgia in particular .
lastly , you will note that i have left my name off the list . i have done this for two reasons : because i have worked on all these deals , and because i want to motivate people in the group by providing them recognition for their efforts . the specific contribution made by the individuals on this list varies by the skill set of these individuals . some co - leads have played a more technical role , while others have played more of a commercial role .
i will be prepared to go through this list in detail on monday , and provide a more comprehensive explanation of the listed individual ' s contributions . i will also be prepared to talk about the contributions to our development efforts that others have made .
please let me know if you ' d like to talk about this list this weekend . you can page me at 1 - 888 - 876 - 3206 .
regards ,
ben
