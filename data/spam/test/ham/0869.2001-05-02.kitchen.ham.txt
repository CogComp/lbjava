subject : easier for epmi / ees to purchase from industrials
attached is ferc authorization for epmi and ees to purchase power from industrials nationwide ( effective march 6 , 2001 - - does not expire ) . the industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from ferc ( subject to epmi and ees making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for the industrials ) .
specifics :
owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used primarily for back - up for self - generation ( who will be " public utilities " subject to the federal power act only while they sell at wholesale ) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to epmi and ees without prior notice under section 205 of fpa ( would usually require 60 day advance notice filing ) .
- - waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial ; however , the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they are selling at wholesale .
- - epmi and ees will make the ferc quarterly filings on behalf of the industrials for any of these purchases . our report must show the names of the industrial ; aggregate amount of capacity and / or energy purchased from each seller ; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller . accounting / commercial folks for epmi and ees - - please make sure these purchases are flagged in the accounting system , since the report will be separate from our big quarterly reports .
- - this does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any rules or tariffs of its host utility . this does not authorize an industrial to resell power it purchases ( only can sell what it generates ) ; unless otherwise allowed ( or not precluded ) by its retail tariff .
west desk : this is similar to the authorization that ferc gave last week to purchases from industrials in wscc .
