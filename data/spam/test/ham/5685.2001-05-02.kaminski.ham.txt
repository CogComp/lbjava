subject : summer work . .
long time no see ,
how have you been . . . must be busy and living a challenging life ?
i have been pretty busy too ,
to finish a project and write a paper , these days .
everything looks going ok for my summer internship .
i took necessary steps to work out of campus , and sent
signed contract to molly a week ago . .
here is what i am expecting to do in the summer .
please let me know if you have any change in mind .
actually , i wonder a little bit if dealbench changed its business model . . .
and maybe you got priority in something different
because it has been quite a while since we talked .
i ' d like to what ' s going on in dealbench team . . .
raghavan and ross ,
if we talk over phone it will be great !
dr . kaminski ,
if you think there is something else interesting to work with during the
summer ,
to both you and i , please let me know .
my interest is auction , market design , and simulation .
i am taking a financial engineering class , ( mostly on option pricing )
and working on electricity generator valuation problem based on
spark spread option .
all of you ,
let ' s keep in touch until we meet in june ! !
best regards ,
jinbaek
