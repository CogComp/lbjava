Subject: re : cost / revenue information
the below email is in regards to the cost charts sheri asked that i provide
to greg piper . the comment , " the goal for us is to put the information into
a form that i can share with potential external counterparties on tuesday " is
why i am forwarding the email to you . i will dig deeper to understand the
purpose . also , sally the gas chart is for both financial and physical and
the increase in cost for february is due to social security and unemployment
taxes . these cost were incorrectly recorded to our cost centers and will be
reversed during march .

i hope your mom ' s surgery went fine .
thanks for pulling the info together . i have meetings on monday until 3 pm ,
but i believe that david can get together with you on monday morning .
perhaps david can pull in someone else from our team also . the goal for us
is to put the information into a form that i can share with potential
external counterparties on tuesday . thanks again for your help .
