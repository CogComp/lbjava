Subject: headcount latitude
louise , given the number of declines , is there any latitude in moving up the canadian headcount . i believe we cut very deep on the lst go round . specifically , there is a couple of analysts and one manager on the commercial side and on the non - commercial side we ' d like to have at least one if not two admins for answering the phones ( admins are roughly u . s . $ 15 k / annum and ours are extremely good ) . we still might come in under our initial headcount given the decline probabilities , but i would like to offer additional jobs asap as opposed to waiting for responses .
