Subject: howard & lawrence for vince
hey vince !
here is a picture of howard lin and picture of lawrence ( the guy i spoke to
you about over the telephone ) and his new resume .
i will call alec tonight in london to let him know that you sent the " other
howard " ( howard haughton over to enron uk ) .
lawrence has banking and online experience with hsbc - he is being examined
only by one other company that i know of ( williams ) that is my competitor . he
also went to the chief investment officer of the san diego pension fund ( a
friend of mine ) . i don ' t think he is a " best fit " - but , if you like him - i ' ll
get him for you !
i have a great relationship with him .
ok !
thanks ,
jeff wesley
ps - i kinda like lawrence ' s " look " , vince .
always held in strict confidence .
