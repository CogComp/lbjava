Subject: united way update
at the end of the leadership giving campaign , ews had reached $ 488 , 832 in pledges , which is 38 . 31 % of our campaign goal of $ 1 , 276 , 000 . enron ' s plan calls for leadership givers to represent 60 % of the total pledge goal , so we are short 21 . 69 % or $ 276 , 768 . even more disappointing was the weak 7 . 85 % participation rate by those employees in the leadership level ( i . e . , over $ 90 , 000 in base pay ) . while part of this shortfall was caused by the decision not to conduct a leadership campaign for ebs , most of the other business units / functional groups in ews did not fare too well either .
