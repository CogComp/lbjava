you are right . ena owns the intellectual property rights to eol .
taylor just told me that and explained that the goal is to convey a license but to keep the ip in ena for potential later sale .
also , we are preparing for a scenario that is north america gas and power in houston , calgary and portland at about 50 % flow going forward and the rest ( egm , eim , ebs , ees , etc . ) as orderly shutdown over 90 days . i assume our front , mid and back office systems , or at least parts , would be conveyed to the new owner .
