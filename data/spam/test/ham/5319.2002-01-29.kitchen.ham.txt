Subject: hsr issue re marketing
an issue has been raised whether masters can be sent out prior to hsr approval . there is not a problem with more general marketing . we need to have a meeting with the marketers and the lawyers later in the week to come to conclusion on this issue . this should not in any way slow down the work on the forms !
