vince ,
good to hear from you and i ' m glad you ' re available . how is wednesday at
2 : 30 ?
i did look at eol and am not surprised to see its quality . i was unable to
say much about it in my risk electricity hedging and trading report because
of deadline pressures . how is the site doing ? i am intrigued by the
competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that goldman ,
morgan , bp and shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours . talk
about a shotgun marriage !
if we have time next week , i could step you through our website - -
www . weathereffects . com . i ' m very proud of what we ' ve done . i can ' t give out
a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the
phone using my password . it ' s a very ambitious site - - with state - of - the - art
wsi weather ( seasonal , 6 - 10 , and day to day ) driving a good load model for
pjm and nepool . esai contributes oil and gas input price forecasts , capacity
judgments , and " herding " ideas to develop power price forecasts for same
time periods . after one month ' s full - bore effort , i ' m pleased with the
results ( e . g . , we forecast nepool onpeak to be $ 43 and it turned out $ 46 ) .
have a great weekend .
ed
