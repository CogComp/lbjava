hi louise -
thought this might be helpful in your review of canada ' s cap charge . i ' ve left a new plan for canada , upstream ( jean moved her cap charge from upstream executive to offshore ) , and restructuring ( we adjusted their margin target to ( $ 20 . 7 m ) - they ' ve called themselves merchant asset mgmt on the plan presentation - would you like for me to make the name change on our management summary ? ) additionally , i ' ve left the february 2001 team income statement booklet for your review as well . these items are in tammie ' s chair . please let me know if you have any questions - x 30352 . thanks !
