subject : eel directors and above
hi louise .
i received this spreadsheet from gemma butler in london which shows all director - level and above employees for eel .
no filters are currently active , and all female employees are at the top .

unfortunately , myself and jean have limited knowledge of the people in the international offices .
would you be able to identify possible candidates for us ?
here is a breakdown of the current state of the presentation . . .
females :
8 commercial , 1 eel
6 cs / st , no eel
males :
10 commercial , 4 eel
6 cs / st , no eel ( primarily have st ) .
i think we need a few additional commercial females , and a few male & female cs candidates to give us a balanced portfolio .
although i think the london office will be closed by the time i get the names to them today , we should have their data by early next week .
also , i have included a spreadsheet which includes the career data for the employees marcello romano identified , as well as a few others .
there does not appear to be the type of candidates you are wanting , but i ' ll let you make the call .

thanks ,
sunjay
