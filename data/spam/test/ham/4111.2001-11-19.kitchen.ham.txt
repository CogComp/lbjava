Subject: sale of napoleonville land
louise ,
tomorrow , i am flying to buffalo , ny for thanksgiving with my father . as such , for the potential sale of the napoleonville land , julie gomez will sign on my behalf for lrci inc . after both appropriate commercial , accounting and legal parameters have been met . the status is as follows :
texas brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 mm and has the opportunity to counter . texas brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $ 2 . 35 mm .
reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the " act of sale " document . as such , gerald nemec ( my legal ) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups ( i . e . litigation and environmental ) .
i am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving . however , this bidding " war " has the potential for ena to extract an even higher auction price . the approximate book value of the land is $ 1 . 4 mm .
i can be reached via blackberry or cell ( 713 - 302 - 4187 ) . eva rainer , manager , is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions .
regards , mrha
