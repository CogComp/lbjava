stinson ,
henwood can help us with the project in our time frame ( end of january ) . the
henwood person who will coordinate the project is david branchcomb , located
in london . he will have to involve the henwood ? manager for asia , who works
out of australia .
i told him that you would call him wednesday morning on his cell phone to set
up a conference call later the same day with the guy in australia . given time
difference it may happen late afternoon .
they expect that we shall give them the specs of the project . it makes sense
to involve sandeep at the conference call : he will be very specific about our
needs . i sent you his coordinates in an earlier message . sandeep may have to
come to the office : i don ' t know if anita knows how to set up a conference
call .
david ' s phone numbers :
44 207 242 8950
44 787 942 5375 ( cell ) .
i may be at the office in the morning for an hour or two .
