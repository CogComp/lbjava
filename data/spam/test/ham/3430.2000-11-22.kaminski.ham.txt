maureen ,
i apologize that your phone was disconnected in error . at this time your
phone is working and your voice mail box needs to be set up . i would like to
add however , i do not appreciate your disrespect and unreasonable demands
placed on my employees . they were not the cause of this problem and can only
relay your information to the appropriate group .
