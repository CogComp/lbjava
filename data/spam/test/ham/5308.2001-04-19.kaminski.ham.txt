subject : re : london status report - research weather
hi mike ,
please find a list of our current daily products and services , together with
identified research projects ( to - date ) for european weather research - this
has been forwarded to tani nath to aid her recommendations for a 2 nd met . for
london .
1 ) this week :
* a meeting with james willis ( agriculture ) has been arranged for monday
afternoon to discuss weather input for softs .
* following suggestion from tani , meeting has been pencilled in with pierre
aury ( coal trading ) to discuss weather input .
* at present we are providing kristian lande ( continental power ) with daily
precipitation outlook for spain - he is working towards getting a daily
weather breifing for power set up .
* a meeting with alex mcleish ( global products ) has been pencilled in
following his return from houston to discuss the way forward in building a
forecast model for crude api based on hdds on either side of the atlantic .
* we have made progress in getting additional information on european ports
following meeting with scott moncrieff and sylvie mostura ( shipping and
transportation ) - we now get forwarded daily reports for some baltic , black
sea , scandanavian , italian and indian ports , which include various degrees of
weather information .
* we now supply north sea conditions and forecasts as a part of the 8 am uk
gas briefing .
* we ' ve added a midday " update " for uk gas traders if / when mrf ensembles
warrent changes or clarification .
* following extremely useful meeting with tani nath , it is now clear that need
for 2 nd meteorologist will have to be cleared with her superiors here in
london before moving forward .
2 ) still to follow up
* get meeting with chris mahoney to determine if we can provide any
additional support ( e . g . daily briefing ) for crude and products .
* follow up on a potential morning briefing for continental power .
* get meeting arranged with david anderson at ecmwf to discuss data products
and services they provide .
* continue to investigate model grib data to produce a " confidence interval "
for model output .
* meet with ross mcyntire to determine needs from weather drivatives
* develop a standard hydro product ( daily updates ) for continental power
( spain specifically )
* develop forecast verification scheme and internal forecasting tools
* avistar recorded europe briefings
3 ) challenges :
* still appears to be some confusion over whether we are moving desks this
afternoon or not !
* karin ahamer ( the team assistant here ) is going to verify later exactly
which pcs we will be using from monday next week ( some of the loaner pcs we
are currently using contain important software left over from their previous
users ) .
* our time in assembling reports is becoming more efficient on a daily
basis . however as our product load increases this may become a factor over
next few weeks .
