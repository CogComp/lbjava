fyi . please note that the pricing to peoples will be under a netback arrangement and has changed from its original proposal . however , it will be for the same original volume of 30 , 000 mmbtu / day from the 30 wells . enron only has to schedule from 3 meters , not 30 wells . as such , the inital pricing of $ . 01 / mmbtu no longer applies .
regards , jean

linda roberts , george smith and i had a meeting with rick fox , cfo for peoples energy production ( pep ) . rick provided our group with a detailed description of the services required by pep . the scope of services has changed . the 30 wells we originally priced all feed into three common points reducing the work required by logistics . pep does not need access to our system . ena upstream will be marketing all the supply under a net back arrangement .
enron producer one will include ena and ats . ena will provide monthly reports to pep and ats related to the metered volumes and prices . ats will provide the e & p revenue distributions back to pep .
we will be making our proposal to pep on monday april 30 , 2001 .
