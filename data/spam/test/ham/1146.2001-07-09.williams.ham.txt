Subject: transcript of a bizarre and unusual telephone call from the iso
here is the transcript of the iso ' s real - time desk asking enron real - time trader ryan slinger to help the iso " set " the market - clearing price ( " mcp " ) for replacement energy . the iso wanted enron to help set the mcp for replacement energy at $ 91 . 86 , because the iso was upset that the mcp had dropped to a penny , and now market participants were buying the iso ' s excess energy a penny ( after having sold it to the iso for $ 91 the day before ) .
there are two phone calls . the first call is the iso calling to ask us to help it to set the price . the next call occurs three minutes later and is the iso calling because we didn ' t put in the bid . our trader told the iso that he had to " talk to his boss " because he " didn ' t want to do anything wrong . "
note : i have just learned a complicating detail : coincidentally , our desk did put in a bid for $ 91 . 86 for hour 18 , which was what the iso had requested . however , the bid had been formulated before the iso called our desk .

iso : allen : can you guys continue to put the price at that ?
enron : ryan : at what ? at $ 91 . 86 ?
iso : allen : yes
enron : ryan : um , ? .
iso : allen : this isn ' t on a recorded line , but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing . it would be good to keep it [ the market clearing price for replacement energy ] at a higher price . it doesn ' t matter how many megawatts you put it at , but we want to clear it at a higher price .
enron : ryan : wait , you said we ' re not on a recorded line , or we are ?
iso : allen : we ' re not . no , we ' re not , okay . we already talked to the day - ahead research guy and myself , but we saw you guys clear at $ 91 and we wanted you , if it ' s possible , to continue to set that , whether it ' s 20 mw or whatever you want to put in there .
enron : ryan : okay , um ? . .
iso : allen : we want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market .
enron : ryan : oh yeah . because it had been clearing like at $ 100 , hadn ' t it ?
iso : allen : not replacement .
enron : ryan : oh , not replacement ?
iso : allen : no . what happened is that we bought it back ? . see , the day - ahead was purchased at like $ 100 and then what happened is that the hour - ahead . . . a bunch of these people were buying it back for a penny over the [ inter ] ties . they were faking it . so we wanted to keep the price up high .
allen and ryan : unintelligible .
enron : ryan : so they were selling it , oh , in the day ahead , and buying it back ? .
iso : allen : buying like 60 bucks . . . trying to make money off of it , then basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny .
enron : ryan : oh , that ' s ridiculous .
iso : allen : that ' s really ticking us off and right now . . .
enron : ryan : that to me signals , that ' s probably powerex , isn ' t it ?
iso : allen : there ' s about four of them right now .
enron : ryan : shit .
iso : allen : and for the day - ahead for tomorrow , we didn ' t , we didn ' t , we took them out . basically , we ' re not allowing anything over the ties .
enron : ryan : i didn ' t submit one for 17 or ? .
iso : allen : that ' s fine . they ' ll probably go to a penny and they ' ll probably get excited and do a bunch , and we ' ll hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91 .
enron : ryan : okay . all right . well , i ' ll see what i can do .
iso : allen : i appreciate it . it ' s actually in the best interest for the state and the iso [ with ] what these guys are doing , so we are trying to put a stop to it .
enron : ryan : okay .
iso : allen . thanks , bye .
