louise :
our proposal is for ena to assume the nominal cost of the turbine as of jan 1 , ' 01 , exclusive of carrying costs up to that date . from jan 1 forward we will assume full responsibility for any carrying costs , and any continuing payment obligations under the purchase contract with westinghouse .
the nominal cost of the turbine as of jan 1 , ' 01 exclusive of carrying costs , is $ 22 , 947 , 599 . this is the amount that we propose ena to assume with respect to the turbine .
the carrying cost through jan 1 to be assumed by calme as part of this proposal is $ 2 , 055 , 330 . this amount reflects the actual carrying charges imposed by enron corp on calme based upon the payments made to westinghouse under the purchase agreement .
the continuing payment obligation to be assumed by ena under the purchase contract with westinghouse is $ 1 , 558 , 401 . this amount reflects the actual final payment due under the contract , which is due at commercial operations .
please let me know if you need anything else to resolve this , or if you have any questions .
regards ,
ben
