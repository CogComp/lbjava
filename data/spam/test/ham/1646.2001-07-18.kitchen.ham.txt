Subject: technical organization
louise ,
i understand that there ' s a lot of discussion going on about the approach to organizing our technical resources . i would appreciate the opportunity to provide input to that process .
you don ' t know much about me , but i have been with enron for over eleven years . i was hired enron power corp . as project engineering manager for the teesside project , was promoted to general manager of engineering concurrently with being teesside pem , and built up the engineering group there . i moved into front end development support and have worked on development projects in mexico , south america , the middle east and europe . a little over three years ago i was assigned to support ena efforts and i was intimately involved in the 99 peakers on . last november i transitioned my ee & cc development engineering group from ee & cc to ena as part of the technical services group .
all of the above is only to say that i have pretty broad exposure to the overall organization . i know a lot of the people , a lot of the history and i a little about how this machine seems to work . i would be happy to give my perspective on the issues if it is any value to you . although i should provide truth in advertising and warn you that i am pretty direct and have fairly definitive opinions on most subjects . in other words , my opinion is way too easy to get .
if i can add anything to the process , please let me know .
