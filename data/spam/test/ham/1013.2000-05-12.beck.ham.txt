if todd was unaccompanied , we would have paid o 2167 p / m . the flat he is
occupying is o 2817 p / m , difference of o 650 p / m . not sure if this is going to
be relevant enough to the rc . we definitely could have rented the place so it
would not have been left empty .
let me know if you need anything else .
