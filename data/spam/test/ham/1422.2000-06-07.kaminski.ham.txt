Subject: resume of phil roan , koch weather desk
shirley ,
phil roan , the quantitative analyst from koch ' s weather derivatives group
will be here on the afternoon of friday june 16 , beginning say , at 1 : 30 or
2 : 00 . vince asked me to ask you to put a set of interviews together ( as i
understand , vince himself will be unavailable that day ) .
mark tawney should see him ; someone from weather marketing and / or
structuring should see him , e . g . gary taylor and / or michael nguyen ; some more
people from research should grill him on technical and meteorology issues ,
e . g . vasant and / or zimin as well as mike roberts or someone on his team . phil
has only been a " quant " since the departure of koch ' s previous weather quant
in february ; before that he was koch ' s weather " risk manager " . i am still not
sure what the distinction means , but we do need to find out how much he knows
about option pricing and meteorology . even though his expressed desire is to
focus on weather derivatives , we should also assess how useful he would be
from research group ' s perspective , since research will likely be his official
home .
finally , jere overdyke and / or someone else from his group ( george carrick ,
if available ) should also get a chance to meet with him . i ' ve already spoken
with phil , but i ' d like to sit in with either vasant or zimin or mike when
they interview him , since i wasn ' t able to ask any technical questions .
if i ' m counting correctly , that should amount to five interview sessions ,
perhaps less if we interview in groups of two . phil ' s resume is enclosed
below .
joe
p . s . i will also forward this to jason sokolov . he will let you know if any
people from rac would also like to meet with him .
