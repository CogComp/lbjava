michelle : thanks for sending this to me so quickly . i do have a couple more questions for you .
1 . what is the discount rate you will be using to calculate the npv in your open season ?
2 . can an affiliate of a company also place a bid for up to the volume available to needles ?
3 . how does the right of first refusal work ?
for example , when we spoke earlier i think you used an example of a $ 3 . 00 bid for 1 year getting equal value as a $ . 30 bid for 10 years ( adjusted for npv , of course ) and the winning party got a rofr . ( let ' s say the 1 year bid won ) . at the end of the year , is the rofr calculated on the $ 3 . 00 value the shipper holds the transport at or is it based on current market conditions . let ' s say the market value has collapsed and the market views this capacity as worth only $ . 28 / dth and the current shipper is willing to match that rate does that mean he can retain the capacity ? then for what term , whatever the market bids that piece for or will there be a set time the ( in years ) that the holder of the capacity will have to match regardless of what the bidder bids ?
i hope this example makes sense . if not , please give me a call to discuss at ( 303 ) 252 - 6224 .
thanks for your help .
