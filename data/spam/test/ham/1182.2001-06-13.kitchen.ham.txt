Subject: nanny : packet , taxes , criminal check
louise and marcus ,
i hope you were all ( including extended family members ) safe and sound during the recent storms and that there was no damage to your home , your belongings or your family traveling to and from the airport .
criminal check :
as fate would have it , instead of going by the county clerks office on friday when i left , i decided to go on monday morning . due to the storms , they are still inoperable . i will continue to follow - up and will definitely be one of the first in line when they open .
packet :
i have received no packets . as you recall i ordered two last week . i have left voice mails today and yesterday with no response . they could be flooded as well . i will continue to try to ascertain the status of the information packet .
taxes :
i spoke with richard frank , cpa and will provide him all of our ( pertinent ) email information regarding the nanny and tax issues . once he reviews it he will contact marcus and / or myself regarding outstanding questions .
misc :
i am hand delivering the i - 9 form , ss 4 form and the information i obtained from enron life works / the new enron kids ' center to marcus today .
welcome summer !
best regards ,
bobbi
