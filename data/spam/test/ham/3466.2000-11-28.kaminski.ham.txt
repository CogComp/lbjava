dear sir :
the scientific computation group at the university of
waterloo , ontario , canada , has recently started to be very
interested in the recent developments of the bandwidth
market . we find that the specifics of the bandwidth market
offer challenges from the modelling point
of view .
however , we have encountered difficulties when looking for
data , and we were wondering if you could help us . specifically
we would like to know for a given city pair for the different
existing type of lines ( e . g . oc 3 , ocl 2 , oc 48 . . . . )
1 . what has been the spot lease prices ( e . g . $ / line - type / mile ) for
the past 12 months ?
2 . what is the price of the dark fiber for a given type of line ?
3 . what is the maintenance cost $ / month ?
( for the same lines , e . g . oc 3 , ocl 2 , oc 48 , . . . )
4 . what is the upgrading cost for the different lines ?
( e . g . how much does it cost to upgrade )
oc 3 - - > ocl 2
oc 3 - - > oc 48
ocl 2 - - > oc 48
5 . how long does it take to upgrade a line from a certain
capacity to another ( e . g . 1 month , 2 month , . . . ) ?
we realize that some of these questions may ask for confidential
data , in that case we would really appreciate if an order of magnitude
was provided . i look forward to hearing from you .
sincerely ,
yann d ' halluin
