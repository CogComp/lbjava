can you do me a favor when you have a minute , i am doing a will and need details of my stocks and options and i wanted to check out that i have everything included as i do not information on all of it ( particularly a recent tranche ) . can you email me a spreadsheet ( usual password ) or if that is too much of a problem just the nominal values of vested and unvested at current enron stock prices .
thanks
louise
