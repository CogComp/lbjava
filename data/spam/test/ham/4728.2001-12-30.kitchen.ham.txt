subject : fw : re - start / integration planning
although yesterday ' s meeting was excellent , we do need to get a lot more detailed on the re - start plans . i would like everyone to have completed their re - start plans by the end of next week for mid / back office . i realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner / buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with .
as you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing .
let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a jan 20 restart .
thanks
louise

subject : re - start / integration planning
we have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the re - start / integration plans for netco . so far , we have primarily focussed on the mid / back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors . several plans are in progress : -
+ infrastructure jenny rub
+ development jay webb
+ enrononline webb / forster
+ hr david oxley
+ cash management tom myers
+ credit debbie brackett
the rest will be completed shortly .
we now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus . john and i would like to receive the plans " re - start / integration " plans by january 7 th , 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups . the focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible . i have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but i thought it might help . please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually .
