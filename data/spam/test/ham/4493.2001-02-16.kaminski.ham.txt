Subject: re : blood bank
vince ,
i must apologize . i have not had time to look over the proposal in any
detail . when i first spoke with your friend , it was apparent that he was
still pre - business plan stage . he has since sent me some ideas and
information . i think the concept has merit , but there are so many political
issues that i am concerned about the ultimate business viability .
give me the weekend to look over the information .
thanks ,
mark
