Subject: corrections ( ? ) to rings 4 , 5 , 6 , 7
for rings 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ( all pjm ) i noticed that there is an inconsistency between ( 1 ) the " term " section , which refers to " central prevailing time " and ( 2 ) the " scheduling " section , which refers to " eastern prevailing time . "
working under the assumption that the " term " for pjm is supposed to refer to " eastern prevailing time , " i changed the " term " section of ring " h " to ept to match the scheduling section .
i suggest we check with melissa murphy tomorrow to confirm the correct time zone for the " term " section of pjm , so that we can make appropriate corrections - - - either to ring h , or to rings 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 .
