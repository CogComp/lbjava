Subject: california update - - 07 . 24 . 01
the assembly passed the budget late last night .
the assembly recessed without passing out any energy bill .
there is some talk of a working group being convened beginning next week comprised of legislative staff and industry to continue to try to work out a deal .
for now , however , the free world is safe from the ca assembly and the senate - - they ' ve left and all legislative activity is on hold until the 20 th of august , unless leadership , or the governor tries to bring them back early .
the activity now moves to the puc .
best ,
