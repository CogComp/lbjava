regarding the potential for enron to work on another vitro type project , the attached email gives the name of the company with whom we were discussing the turbine sale . we are trying to find out more information on the project and will forward that to you as we receive it . if you would like me to deal with someone directly in mexico , please let me know who that should be . we are also working with maria elena garcia to develop potential customers in mexico for a straight turbine sale . she has indicated that she believes there may be some additional potential for cogen applications with these units .
thanks ,
brett
