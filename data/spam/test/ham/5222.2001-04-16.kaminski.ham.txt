Subject: godbole report
vince / stinson ,
this is a summary fo the report submitted by the godbole committee appointed
by the state government to review the dabhol project .
the report clearly suggests renegotiation on the tariff . a lot of what they
mention is something we won ' t agree to . however , to me it seems apparent
that this can be worked out .
regards ,
sandeep .
