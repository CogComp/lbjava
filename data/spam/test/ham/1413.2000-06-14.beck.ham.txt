Subject: summer cookout
sally ,
i had talked to ted and he mentioned the cookout you were planning for the ou
group this summer . please let me help with any of the logistics ,
set - up , and clean up . i know these things require a great deal of effort ,
especially when you welcome people to your personal residence . i want to ,
and insist on helping in whatever way i can . i am really grateful for what
you have done for the university of oklahoma and i am also aware of
the great sacrifices you make for enron . if possible , we might schedule a
lunch to discuss the specifics . i would also be grateful if we could discuss
my most recent opportunity at enron , texas risk . i realize the there is a
great deal i can gain from this move and i would appreciate any insight on how
to obtain the most from this experience .
thanks
jody
