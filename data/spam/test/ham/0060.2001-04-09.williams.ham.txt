Subject: vacation payback
leaf -
i just received a call from payroll - they miscalculated your vacation payback .
rather than the $ 1 , 113 . 66 , you actually only owe $ 957 . 04 ( they forgot to take away your or state taxes in the first calculation ) .
can you please write another check and we will void the first one ? do you want the check returned to you ?
sorry for the inconvenience . please let me know if you have any questions .
