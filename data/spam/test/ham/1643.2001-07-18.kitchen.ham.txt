what people know :
hertzberg ( et al ' s ) bill ( 82 xx ) was heard in an " informational " hearing today and still sits in the assembly energy committee . it will be heard again tomorrow ( perhaps beginning at 10 am ) , at which time parties will have a chance to support / oppose and ask for amendments . most , including us , oppose unless significantly amended .
the wright ( d ) - richman ( r ) bill ( 83 xx ) was heard in an " informational " hearing today and still sits in the assembly energy committee . it will be heard again tomorrow , at which time parties will have a chance to support / oppose and ask for amendments . from our perspective , this is the best bill out there yet , though it still has serious problems - - - it isn ' t available electronically yet , but should be tomorrow , and i ' ll distribute then . the chances of the joint d - r bill being successful are slim , however , since it ' s up against the speakers competing bill . there is talk that the speaker will try to negotiate with wright / richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill ( 82 xx ) .
the original version of the governor ' s mou bill sits in the senate . most believe that burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail .
the senate ' s version of the mou ( sher - peace - kuehl ) ( 78 xx ) came out today . it will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day . notably , it kills direct access completely and makes edison shareholders responsible for that portion of edison ' s debt owed to suppliers . in short , a very bad bill .
burton ' s 18 xx , which would de - link the bond issuance ( to pay back the general fund ) from the dwr contracts is likely to pass the senate tomorrow or the next day . many - - including enron - - support the bill ( though we are supporting it behind the scenes ) .
what people don ' t know :
whether there ' s the time or the will in the assembly and senate to achieve by friday a single , comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature .
whether the legislature would postpone its month - long recess if the legislature hasn ' t finished a bill by friday ( most folks think they will not postpone ) .
whether it ' s true that , irrespective of the energy issue , the legislature will fail to get the budget completed by friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway , in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time .
odds - makers still say it ' s better than 50 - 50 that the legislature does not get the edison bills done by friday and leaves on on its 30 - day vacation .
best ,
