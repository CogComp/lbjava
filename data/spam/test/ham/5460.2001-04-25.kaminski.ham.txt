we received some correspondence this morning from jinbaek in which he says he
plans to start on june 4 , 2001 . since we are trying to offer a package
comparable to that of an associate in the program , i assume we will also pay
for his plane ticket here ? ? ? just wanted to check before i contacted
him . . . . , so i ' ll wait to hear from you .
thanks ,
molly
