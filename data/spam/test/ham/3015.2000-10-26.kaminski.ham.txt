subject : actions on anjam ' s resignation
all
my preferred approach to dealing with anjam ' s departure is given below .
these recommendations are informed by the fact that i don ' t feel anjam has
much to offer his next employer , except what code and data he can remove from
enron :
hr - type stuff :
1 . get anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible . there is no need for
him to remain on the floor .
2 . determine where anjam is heading . we need to know who is going to know
our positions and curves next .
it - type stuff :
1 . ask him to catalogue the contents of his h : drive , since the rest of the
group will need to support his work in the future . this should take no more
than a day or two .
2 . get it to obtain their backups of anjam ' s h : drive for weekly intervals
over the last two months . this will allow us to determine what he has
deleted .
3 . get it to provide a snapshot of anjam ' s notes folders , and provide records
of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months . i ' m worried
about code / data he may have zipped up and mailed out .
4 . ask it to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from
anjam ' s c : drives . there may be useful info here too .
