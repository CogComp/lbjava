Subject: berney
i spoke with berney this am . as you mentioned , i believe he needs some more $ ( a risk premium in his words ) . i told him that the intent is not to simply be a block - trading spec shop , but we do have a genuine interest in structured customer deals . also , the size of his group is irrelevant because the marketers will be asked to structure on their own and i will want berney to have some oversight to ensure quality and consistency , as well as helping out on all of the big deals .
