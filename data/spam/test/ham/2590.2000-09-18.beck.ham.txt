subject : upcoming compensation analysis
to all energy operations directors :
my name is todd burke and i ' m a compensation specialist with ena human
resources ( see attached bio ) . as you know , sally beck has requested that i
conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current pay arrangements for all
energy operations staff . the purpose of this analysis will be to ensure that
the department ' s current pay arrangements are in line with the competitive
marketplace . each component of pay will be examined individually and within
the context of enron ' s compensation philosophy ( e . g . , base salary , bonus ,
long - term incentives and total compensation ) .
the process will begin with a series of interviews which will be conducted in
two stages :
stage 1 - data gathering : the focus of this stage will be upon gathering data
around your perceptions of your group ' s current pay arrangements and give you
the opportunity to address any of the internal and external inequities you
perceive to exist .
stage 2 - job matching : the focus of this stage will be on job matching - we
will establish a mutually agreed upon time to meet and discuss which
positions in our salary surveys most accurately reflect the roles and
responsibilities of your staff . we will not be able to match 100 percent of
your jobs to the jobs contained in the salary surveys . non - benchmark jobs
will be reviewed using a job " slotting " approach .
to help facilitate the matching process , i will be assembling handouts
containing the job descriptions taken from the relevant salary surveys which
i will send to each of you in advance of our stage 2 meeting . the intent
here is to give you the opportunity to " pre - match " your respective jobs
thereby minimizing the time required to achieve this objective during our
stage 2 meeting . it will be critical that you are comfortable with the
matches that you agree to as these matches will be used when gathering
relevant market data . the data will only be as good as the matches .
following the conclusion of stage 2 , i can begin gathering the market data
based on the results of the job matching exercise and prepare a comparative
analysis that i will be presenting to sally beck .
i will be contacting each of you in the next few days to set up the stage 1
interviews . i look forward to working with each of you and to the successful
completion of this project .
please call with any questions or comments . i can be reached at x 39437 .
kind regards ,
todd burke
