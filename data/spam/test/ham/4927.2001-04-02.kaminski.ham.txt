subject : real options
vince ,
the sydney office is currently evaluating a proposal that involves an option
to participate in building a wind farm . should this proceed , we would like to
mark this option " to market " .
have the research group completed any work on methods for booking and
remarking real options ? alternatively , do you have any suggestions as to the
best way to value , and book , real options fairly ?
regards
paul smith
