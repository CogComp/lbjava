Subject: fw : socalgas capacity policy
please find attached a letter from lad and pat of socal . tw was requested by socal to reallocate the needles " window " on intraday 1 cycle last friday . socal lowered the " window " below tw ' s firm requirements . this has not been the policy previously followed by the two companies . once the socal " window " was established on the timely cycle , the window would not change for that gas day . i did not want to cut tw ' s ft shippers late on friday . i wanted time to alert them that this policy was changing and they could not rely on getting the same allocation of gas at needles during each daily cycle .
lynn and i talked with pat davidson and tw has agreed to accomodate any changes ( increases or decreases ) to the " window " during a particular gas day except for the intraday 2 cycle . lynn and i told pat that changing the allocation during intraday 2 cycle would create imbalances on tw ' s system , and tw was not allowed to have shipper imbalances per its tariff .
lynn has prepared an ebb posting alerting our shippers of this change . it will be posted today and the policy will go into affect for friday ' s gas day .
any questions , please call mrs . blair !
