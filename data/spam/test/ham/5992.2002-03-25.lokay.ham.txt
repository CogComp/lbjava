randy ,
mansoor and i met on this topic this morning . we are confirming with perry frazier what , if any , firm commitments we may have on this system to make sure we understand possible impacts of abandoning this station . also , we will meet with the regulatory folks this week to discuss the various regulatory options with them . we will keep you updated as we progress through these meetings .
how much money is required on the ivanhoe station to keep esd compliant ?
thanks , kim .

this is just to follow up on the phone message i left for you today ( friday , march 1 ) .
the questions raised in the employee meeting with stan horton in amarillo this week regarding gas that has gone off the system , had to do with nng facilities not tw .
as i stated in the voice mail , we do have an issue at the ivanhoe station . the hp there has not run in several years , but as long as it ' s in place , we are required to maintain the esd system . we would like to pursue the abandonment in place of the units . if we don ' t do this , we are looking at some significant costs to make repairs and upgrades to the system . our question is , who do we need to work with on this effort ?
thanks for following up so quickly after stan ' s visit .
