subject : a friend of mine
vince ,
last week i was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in
becoming an enron employee . he has a phd and several years research and lab
experience .
richard is afraid that being a phd is a dying breed and may need to go back
to school to obtain an mba . i was wondering if you would mind looking at the
attached resume to assess if you have any interest in richard , or if you feel
i should encourage him to go back to school . i am unclear as to the
qualifications for your group so i apologize if this request is way off base .
thank you for your help ,
