dave ,
sorry it has taken so long to get back to you .
first , regarding handsets . each real - time desk needs 2 handsets . kate symes needs another handset under her desk as well .
also , i need to have my extension displayed on kate symes turret , and on each rt turret as well . also on stewart rosman ' s , greg wolf ' s , les rawson ' s and chris foster ' s . i also need kate symes extension displayed on my turret ( this is an immediate concern beyond the handsets ) . her trid is # 106 ext . 3939 , my trid is # 140 ext . 3730 .
i will address our treatment of handsets with the group .
feel free to grab me this afternoon before 4 pm for a meeting if you still have time .
thanks for the help .
bill
