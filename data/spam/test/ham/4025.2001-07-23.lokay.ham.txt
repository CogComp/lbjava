subject : socal needles " window " allocation
i would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
procedure transwestern is using today for the socal needles " window " allocation .
some of the questions being asked :
1 . why are we allocating for socal , ( at their request ) ?
2 . why are we allowing socal to set the capacity lower than tw ' s primary firm ?
3 . what are the options for tw to change the alloction procedure at needles ?
i am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well . we are looking
at tuesday , july 24 , at 9 : 00 a . m or wednesday , july 25 , 1 : 30 p . m .
please let ava garcia ( 713 - 853 - 5842 ) know which day is better for you . then we will
get a room and let everyone know date and time .
thanks . lynn
