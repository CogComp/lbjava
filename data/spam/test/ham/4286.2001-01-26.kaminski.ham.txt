Subject: remaining work
vince ,
i shipped you the paper along with my note to don . however , i wanted to
share with you what i feel are the remaining " to dos " . specifically ,
1 . we need to document carefully the forces that were behind the original
transformation of enron . specifically , the fallout from deregulation ( take
or pay contract defaults , etc . ) , the impact of the losses from the oil
trading operation , the nationalization of the peruvian pipeline , and the
leveraging up to fend off the carl ichan takeover attempt .
2 . we need to complete / beef up the network strategy section .
3 . finally , the concluding section needs to be carefully crafted to
" hammer home " the basic principles underlying the transformation .
what do you think ?
hope you have a great weekend .
