Subject: appropriate transactions
louise ,
i am under the assumption that we should be moving forward with the sale of pluto / megs to duke energy field services as well as the sale of the napoleonville land to texas brine . in addition , i am trying to work out a transaction to sell the pad gas in dow wells 13 & 14 to an outside counterparty that would be leasing that storage capacity from dow .
are there any types of transactions that would be " inappropriate " to close ? for example , if we do an outsourcing deal for three years , how do we know that dynegy will honor the contract ?
regards , jean
