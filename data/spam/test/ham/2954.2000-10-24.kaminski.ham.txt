dear molly ,
i asked about change of the departure city . they said i should send my ticket
back to get a new ticket . since aquila provides the ticket , it ' s hard for me
to change the departing place . if possible , can i ask you to arrange the one
way flight from houston to seattle on the evening of 25 th ? i ' m sorry for
this .
thank you very much .
sincerely ,
jaesoo lew
