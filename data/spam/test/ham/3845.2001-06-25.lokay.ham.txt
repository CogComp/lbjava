michelle ,
i wanted to know about connecting into the suction of wt - 1 ( not sure i have
the name correct , but the station located off of hwy 180 / 62 carlsbad / hobbs
highway ) . we have a line we are evaluating converting to lean gathering .
it passes about 1 mile from this station . is it possible to connect there .
we will be looking for 19 mmcfd initially and then increasing to 30 if the
volume shows up . we currently have about 13 mmcfd we would take into this
point .
