Subject: merrill investor mtg . on 4 / 10
louise - on april 10 , our analysts at merril lynch ( donato eassey and carl kirst ) are hosting an evening with senior mgmt . of energy merchants for 25 of their top insitutional clients . the event will be at south shore harbor . we have arranged this on your calendar to participate as the senior enron rep . other energy attendees we know of at this point include :
el paso clark smith
dynegy mat shoutsman
williams bill hobbs
duke _ _ _ _ kelly
enron you
i do not have a specific agenda or client list yet - will send as soon as available .
starting mid afternoon ( time to be confirmed - likely between 2 and 2 : 30 ) , merrill will set up 5 separate conference rooms with a company in each conference room . they will rotate 5 clients from room to room every 20 minutes to 1 / 2 hour to meet with each company executive and ir person . they would like each company to put together no more than 5 slides with their strategy , focusing on distinctions . the sessions will be informal , allowing the firms to ask specific company - related questions .
donato has been a long - time sailor and has a 50 + foot boat . at 5 : 00 p . m . they will take the boat to the aquarium ( you can also drive to the aquarium - 10 mins . ) . dinner will be at 6 : 00 and this should be done by 8 : 00 p . m . at that time they will board the boat again back to south shore harbor . whoever decided to drive to dinner can leave at that time ( might be a reasonable alternative for someone in late stage pregnancy ! ) .
we don ' t often ask mgmt . to give up an evening when in houston , but this event is important to merrill . i expect the to 25 firms represented to be worthwhile . i very much appreciate your availability - will be in touch with more specifics .
thanks , paula
