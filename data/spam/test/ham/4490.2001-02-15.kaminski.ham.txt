vince and christie ,
greetings . i am writing because i need a break out of names for the tiger
team group 1 and 3 . i understand tiger team group 2 has decided not to be a
part of enron and i also need to know who those students are . i have a
listing of all the tiger team members but they are listed alphabetically so
that does not help me with my quest . we are trying to firm up the details
and get offers out to the correct people for summer associate positions in
vince ' s department .
regards ,
kristin
