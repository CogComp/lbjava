Subject: fw : read : master netting status request
with respect to the master netting agreements , aquila does not want to enter into one . we have forwarded aquila a new master firm purchase / sale agreement with revised collateral provisions which is the way they want to go .
i hope this meets your current needs .

before you leave today or first thing in the morning , please advise bradford , rohauer and kitchen by email of the status of the particular master netting agreements on which you are working . barbara gray is coordinating the release of the gas receivable financing so that we can execute the netting agreements and she will advise as and when finalized . as previously noted today , the power receivable financing will be released as we sign the netting agreements on a counterparty - by - counterparty basis .
