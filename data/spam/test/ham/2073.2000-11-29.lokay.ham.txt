the iraqi regime  , s campaign to neutralize and eliminate the un sanctions that
have
constrained it for ten years is gathering momentum . of immediate significance
is the
growing likelihood that the antisanctions campaign will again pit iraq
against the un
security council - - this time in a struggle over the financial controls at the
heart of
the " oil for food " program , whose current phase expires december 5 . such a
struggle
could lead to suspension of iraqi oil exports , perhaps for a few weeks , as has
previously occurred , but possibly for considerably longer . should such a
scenario
unfold , the effect on a still tight and nervous oil market would be dramatic .
