hi carrie ,
it was great meeting with you and dean whitaker again last friday , as well as
mr . westbrook .
as we discussed , i have submitted the action learning program materials to
vince kaminski , our managing director of risk analysis and corporate
research . i ' ll be following up with him , and his recommendations for project
proposals next week .
also , i ' ve discussed with our university affairs team setting up the
faculty tours - - we ' re ready when you are ! ! the sooner the better - - i ' d love to
get these in pretty immediately , and in any event , before the reception at
the end of the month . i " ll have cindy derecskey in my group email you - - she
is prepared to set these tours up .
i look forward to continuing to develop the multiple potential dynamics of
the enron - rice relationship !
thanks !
- - christie .
ps : thanks so much for the crystal rice owl - - my participation as a judge in
the rice invitational case competition was my pleasure indeed !

christie ,
i enjoyed visiting with you last week at the jones school . thanks for
taking time to come see us . i wanted to follow up with you regarding the
action learning project program and enron tour . we hope to have enron as
part of the program in 2001 . please let me know how i can help make this
happen . i look for the program to be full before the deadline of december lst . also , i am happy to help organize a group to tour enron . if you were
to participate in the alp program , january / february might be a good time to
put something together with key faculty and the alp team . let me know your
thoughts .
again , many thanks for your continued support of the jones school . i look
forward to hearing from you soon .
