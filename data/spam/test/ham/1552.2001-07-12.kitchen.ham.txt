Subject: prc process - confidentiality
it has come to our attention that confidential information was disclosed after the ews prc meeting this past tuesday . we are very concerned about any breach of confidentiality as it relates to discussions in our prc meetings .
the prc process is very important at enron , and it is absolutely critical that confidentiality is maintained throughout the process . it goes without saying that information discussed during a prc meeting should never be shared outside the meeting . the integrity of the entire prc process is at risk if we cannot trust what is said in the room during a meeting will stay in the room .
the mid - year prc process is still ongoing and many of you will be attending final enron - wide meetings later this month . the process is not complete until these final meetings are concluded , at which time individual feedback should be given . that feedback should be summary information only specific to the individual . information should never be shared about others ' ratings or specific comments made about a person .
please see either one of us if you wish to discuss this further .
