Subject: a simple communication tool
sometimes it ' s the little things that make the biggest impact .
maybe you ' ve never stopped to think about it , but for many of us , post - it
notes may be one of our most frequently used communication tools at enron .
because of this , every employee received , or soon will receive , a packet of
post - it notes with a thought - provoking quote about communication . these
post - it notes reinforce the importance of communication at enron . the
individuals who are quoted on the notepads personify the true meaning of
communication .
we hope that as you use these notepads in your daily work , you will think
about the importance of communication to the continued success of enron and
work just a little harder at communicating more openly at enron .
please email gina taylor ( gtaylor @ enron . com ) for post - it note distribution
inquiries .
