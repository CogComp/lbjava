Subject: re : meeting today and trip to houston
omar , thanks for the presentation and the e - mail . as i tried to emphasize on
the phone call , there will be short - term and long - term efforts to utilize
opnet . often the short - term needs rules at ebs . we will sort out what they
during our discussion in houston . i am confirming the meeting in houston
6 - 8 th .
i shall ask shirely crenshaw to arrange for a conference room on the 19 th
floor . the meeting will be held all day from april 6 th , 7 th and half day 8 th .
the 8 th is a saturday and the meeting will be held to wrap things up if
needed .
ravi .
background info . for enron research people . opnet is a simulation tool that
many in the industry use to do capacity planning to ip based applications and
services on a network . detail adenda will follow .
i wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for the time we had this
morning to discuss the performance engineering program at ebs . i think
you ' ll find that the value to enron from the overall approach is quite
high . i have a much better picture now of some of the short term drivers
that need to be addressed as we move forward . as i work with you , i think
we ' ll quickly emerge with a clear picture of what needs to be done and when .
as soon as you confirm your schedule for april 6 - 8 , i ' ll book my travel to
get to houston . i ' ve already put in a call to opnet technologies to have
them get a resource out to houston on one of those days for a demonstration
and q & a about the opnet toolset .
i ' ll compose an agenda for us to use during that meeting in houston and get
it out to you next week .
if there are any questions , please email me at
