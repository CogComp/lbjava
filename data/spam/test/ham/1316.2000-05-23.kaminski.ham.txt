subject : managing energy price risk articles
hi vince , i have a quick question for you . the eol folks want to put a
couple of articles from the risk book ( managing energy price risk ) on the
internet . i told them that would be a copywrite violation . is there
someone at risk they could call to get permission for this , or is it even
worth calling ? thanks
ross
