outstanding - on the exclusivity - he can have one if he pays for it . just like a turbine its an option price . i suggest $ 2 million for 3 weeks .

i think i have finally broken through the summer malaise in my colleagues here and gotten them fired up about fort pierce . in a nutshell , we are very interested in moving forward on this deal . i ' m going to put together an loi which i hope to have to you before the end of the week .
one question - i know your senior management has a visceral dislike for any type of exclusivity , however my senior management is equally in love with the concept . i ' d like to try to massage something along the lines of our ncph deal but we can discuss .
how does the rest of your week look for getting on a call to go over some of this stuff ? my ncph scars are fading , so i ' m ready to re - engage !
