sally ,
are you aware of the problems with sap ? this error caused an incremental
$ 600 , 000 credit loss to perry gas companies that could have been prevented .
let me know if you have any questions .

russell - as i remember , willie finaled the supply verification and it was
interfaced to sap . this is fine , and then willie was going to net the a / p
and a / r . sap went down after the statement was interfaced , but before willie
was able to block or net the payment . when sap came back up the next day ,
the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire . if
you have any further questions about this , call me . thanks .

willie ,
per our earlier conversation , can you or audrey or bryce , please give further
explain to me as to why the funds were wired to perry gas for purchases from
the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales .
you mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty ' s that net on
sap , although because of timing , the override did not take place .
thank you ,
russell
