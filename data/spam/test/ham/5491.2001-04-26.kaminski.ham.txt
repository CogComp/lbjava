subject : my london " wish list "
hi scott ,
as we discussed , i will be flying to london on monday to spend some time in
enron ' s london office . i am really looking forward to meeting you and the
others i have corresponded with via email , phone , vc , etc .
on yesterday vince , vasant , amitava and i discussed my stay and london and
the desire to make this trip a productive one . hence we came up with the
following " wish list " of things i wish to accomplish while i am over there .
if you think of any other important items to add to this list , please let me
know . after that , we can forward the list to the parties involved to find
out if they will be available to meet with me during my stay in london .
thanks ,
iris
