Subject: risk systems problem log
sally ,
this is my stab at a consolidated list from the last 2 weeks . we may have to
change the format to capture all the issues and explanations , but i wanted
you to have this for your meeting today . rebooks are on the second sheet in
the workbook , but cover only the last week .
let me know if you have questions or need additional info . i ' ll be working
with the business analyst to take over this reporting later this week , so
please comment at your convenience .
