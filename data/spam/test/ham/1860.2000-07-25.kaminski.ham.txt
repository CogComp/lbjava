dear vince ,
i hope your trip to australia was successful . it ' s one of my favorite places
to go .
i ' ve copied you on the email to mike initiating enron ' s trial service to
energycast . thanks for helping to set this up .
would you ask the authorities in enron to refresh my access to enrononline ?
my guest user id as ena 61296 and my guest password was tr 84 byl 3 . they no
longer work , probably because i haven ' t visited the site in months as we
were in full development mode on energycast .
vince , you will note in our website references to forward prices of power in
nepool , nypp , and pjm . we use reuters as a reference - - not satisfactory . if
your traders like energycast and enron became a client , would enron consider
linking its prices to our site ? we have to improve over the reuters quotes
and regard enrononline or bloomberg as the best candidates . over time , as
our service spreads i believe this could help generate deal flow for your
traders .
let me know what you think .
