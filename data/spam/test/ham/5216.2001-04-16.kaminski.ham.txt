hi shirley
in processing your ibuyit approval change request , i discovered that vince kaminski has not been set up with a user id in the eprocurement system . please have him fill out the attached security form and send it to - - sap security @ enron . com
i have already selected the approver role on the second page . we just need the personal information on page one filled out for security purposes . once this is done we can get vince assigned as the approver for cost center 107043 .
thanks ,
michael
