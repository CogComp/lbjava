Subject: approval process for entouch
louise - -
my recommendation for an approval process for entouch is as follows :
1 ) the deadline to provide information for that week ' s issue of entouch will be wednesday at 12 : 00 pm . all information submitted after that time will be held until the following week .
2 ) a draft of entouch will be forwarded to each business unit head ( or their designee ) and commercial group head ( or their designee ) , who has a business highlight or other information appearing in that particular issue . e - mail , phone or in - person approval will be required from either a business unit head ( or their designee ) or commercial group head ( or their designee ) prior to distribution to enron messaging administration on thursday at 2 : 00 pm .
3 ) if approval is not received prior to the deadline , the business highlight or other information will be pulled until approval is received .
4 ) in the event a business unit or commercial group provides information that crosses business unit or commercial group lines , all affected business units and commercial groups will receive the draft and a representative of each involved party will be required to approve per instruction # 2 .
i believe this process will alleviate the two problems that have occurred over the past few months . please advise .
additionally , i have attached the list of contacts kathie uses for gathering entouch information . it includes the primary contacts and their secondary contacts . please feel free to comment on this list .
thanks .
