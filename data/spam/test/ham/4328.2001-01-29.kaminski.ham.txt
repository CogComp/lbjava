i discussed this with vince kaminski and he said that , while we would be
glad to assist you , the time involved in ordering and collecting the money
( they are pretty expensive ) , distributing the books , etc . would be too time
consuming for us at this time .
you can go to www . lacimagroup . com and order the books directly . tell
them you are ordering the books for use at enron and they should give you
a 15 % discount .
i am sorry that we cannot do this at this time .

as we had discussed in our phone conversation friday , i would ask you to
order six copies of the newly enron - published " energy derivatives " for
paradigm strategy group . we do the various derivatives training courses for
enron , and this book will be required reading for all our instructors .
please advise as to the total cost of the books . if payment by check is ok ,
please let me know to whom the check should be made payable .
you can reach me by e - mail , or phone at 281 - 360 - 7822 .
thanks for your help .
