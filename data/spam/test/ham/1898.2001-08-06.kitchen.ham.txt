Subject: your input for management conference
hi louise ,
congratulations on your baby and welcome back .
i ' m preparing the agenda for enron ' s annual management conference again this year . i was hoping i could ask for your insight as i ' m compiling the program .
this year ' s conference theme plays off of our new vision , " becoming the world ' s leading company . " however , the feeling at enron is quite different this year because of the depressed stock price , california , india , broadband , etc . i ' d welcome your thoughts on what the tone for the conference should be , i . e . subdued optimism , reenergizing , etc .
on a related subject , ken lay and jeff skilling will both have an hour on the agenda to speak . this is in response to feedback from employees saying they want to hear more from each of them . afterall , they are both top notch industry speakers . rather than have them give a current " state of the company " address , i intend to have them focus on bigger company , industry or market topics . i ' d love your thoughts on this as well . ( i believe jeff needs to lay out a plan for achieving our vision , and as an economist , ken could give valuable insight into what ' s happening in the market . )
finally , i ' d welcome any ideas for an outside corporate speaker . i ' d very much like to have someone from a corporation that 1 . ) enron people admire ; and 2 . ) has undergone some difficult period in their company ' s history . jeff personally extended an invitation to steve ballmer from microsoft , but he is unable to attend . is there someone you think would be interesting ?
i truly appreciate any consideration you can give this issue . i look forward to your thoughts and ideas .
