thank you . . .
fyi . . . mgu turned an edited contract to us yesterday . two operational issues are outstanding , but we do not view either as significant . we plan to turn executed documents early next week . they are meeting with the mpsc either november 9 th or 12 th . mgu has affirmed ( wednesday ) they remain to deem enron a credit worthy counterparty . as with everything , we are living moment to moment with them , but i hoped i could provide you something positive . i am brutally aware the only truly positive will be an executed agreement .
