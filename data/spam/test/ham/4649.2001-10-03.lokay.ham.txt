david ,
here is legal ' s spin on the amendment . . . can you guys work with this ? do
you know the upstream contract number ? thanks .
for the term of this amendment , transwestern agrees to provide a credit
to the shipper for quantities that could not be scheduled hereunder due
to an event of force majeure , as reasonably determined by transwestern ,
on contract no . _ _ _ ( upstream contract ) rendering the supplies
unavailable . the amount of the credit will be calculated by multiplying
the quantities made unavailable by the discounted rate .
