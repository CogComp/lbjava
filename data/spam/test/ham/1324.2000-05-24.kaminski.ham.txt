hello ainsley :
we are so glad you are interested ! i spoke with vince kaminski and the
procedure is to usually conduct a telephone interview first . this will let
us know exactly where your interests are and establish where you might
fit within our organization .
please let me know your availability and the best time to reach you on
thursday ( the 25 th ) or friday ( the 26 th ) afternoon from 1 : 00 pm to 5 : 00 pm .
also please let me have the telephone number where you may reached
and we will call you . it is easier that way since there will be several of
us involved in the interview . the interview will usually last an hour or an
hour and a half .
thank you ainsley !
sincerely ,
shirley crenshaw
