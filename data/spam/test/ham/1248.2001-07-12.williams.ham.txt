Subject: * information only * work on the floor tonight
all ,
tonight we are having the large ' tv ' removed from the se corner of the floor and the one in the sw corner moved out of the walkway space .
the removal of the large screen is due to how low it hangs and the hazard it presents to people walking in the area . since we do not use that screen , and we do not have a good place to put it , we will store it until a suitable use is identified .
the smaller screen will be move north and east about 3 feet to get it out of the walkway .
regards ,
dave
