subject : argentina power & gas market modelling
i would like to initiate a team to address the continued improvement of the
argentine power & gas market models . i spoke with vince this morning and we
reviewed that history of work to date and what we will need to do from here .
a summary is as follows :
team :
ba members : julian poole lead
mario benitez associate
ba associates : diego hollweck associate
bernardo andrews associate
santiago porta associate
houston members : to be named .
time schedule : as soon as possible . completed before june 1 , 2000 winter in
argentina .
scope of work :
power model : advance the current model from basic load forecasting to
incorporate weather , hydrology , improved short term and long term forecasting .
natural gas model : build a supply and demand load forecasting model
incorporating weather , thermal demand , pipeline flow rates , well head
supply , improved short term and long term forecasting .
phase i - data request
power
historic weather : temperature - daily , hourly , min , max , average
humidity
precipitation
cloud cover
regionally
forward weather : temperature - daily , hourly , min , max , average
humidity
precipitation
cloud cover
regionally
historic hydrology : reservoir levels
reservoir capacity
current hydrology : reservoir levels
remote monitoring : aireal , pressure device , laser
snow pack : density volume and mass
power supply : current and future capacity
transmission
capacity : current and future capacity
natural gas data list to be developed
phase ii - power model development
phase iii - natural gas model development
we will take advantage of the fact that the associates are in houston for the
next two weeks . vince is out next week but we can start with a process
discussion with grant masson next week . julian please get a meeting scheduled
as soon as possible . we should immediately start collecting data .
