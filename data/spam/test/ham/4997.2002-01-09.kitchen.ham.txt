subject : confusion around treasury workstation
there seems to be some confusion around who will own the intellectual property for the treasury workstation application . it was mary ' s and my understanding that the ip would remain with the estate and a license would be given to netco to use the application . jay was under the impression that the ip was to be transferred to netco . could someone please clarify .
the estate ( mary perkins ) would like the ip to remain with the estate . if this is a problem - please call mary directly .
thanks ,
beth
