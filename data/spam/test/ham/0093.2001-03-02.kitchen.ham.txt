steve ,
thanks for forwarding . actually , brian sent it to me on monday , and i followed up with ann and barbara . i have not spoken with brian yet because i am waiting for a green / red light from barbara as far as jade eaton is concerned . barbara and i spoke at length yesterday and she is concerned about the counterparty ' s reaction to a meeting with doj ( even an informal one ) . she plans to get back to me though with regard to whether they want me to get involved at this stage . i spoke to rick as well so he is up - to - date with the current status .
i ' ll let you know if anything further develops . thanks again .
lara
