i had a chance to review your presentation . bill and i have been working
with sally beck , global energy ops and she will identify a resource to help
insure all internal controls ( specific to trading activities ) are in place
in india . as i understand the plan for coal , india will function mostly as
an origination unit with the london office being responsible for supplying
the coal . therefore , the net enron position will probably be carried in the
london books . however , risk books will still be required in india to
determine the net mtm for the 3 rd party sales commitments in india . these
books should include both the intercompany purchase from london and the 3 rd
party sales . the commercial group in india will be responsible for local
curves ( location ( basis ) specific - usually transportation costs ) , and
energy operations ( this will probably be you initially until the trading
activity has grown ) will be responsible for the deal capture process
( including contract administration ) , a settlement process and risk management
administration ( daily valuation and reporting of risk books ) . accounting
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general
ledger and financials . there will also be a logistics process . the
following questions need to be addressed :
with the increased coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be
required ?
my understanding that the london coal group will be responsible for
determining this and working with ted murphy to change the
policy , if necessary .
what trading activities will be performed in india vs . london ?
the answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure
required for the india office .
sally ' s employee starts on monday , i will let you know who she is and
arrange a call . you can rest assured , that although this may seen
complicated ( and it is ) , sally ' s energy ops team will be able to hold your
hand all the way through this process . it will be critical that we
demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place , before we can obtain
sigh - off for trading from rick buy .
looking forward to helping you get this ready for a july 1 start date .
thanks ,
wanda curry

wanda ,
it was nice talking to you on the conference call . have you had a chance to
review my presentation ? . your comments would be extremely helpful to me . when
we setup the risk / credit / accnt / mis / internal control function , i want to make
sure we do it right the first time , keeping in mind that there is always room
for improvement later .
in addition , i would like to discuss with you certain thought i have on the
accounting , budgeting , internal controls and internal audit areas in eipl . do
you plan to travel to india in the near future . please let me know .
thanks and regards .
