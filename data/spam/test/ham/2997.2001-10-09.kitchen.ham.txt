Subject: re : replacement cost values
jim ,
lets get together to discuss - if we need to pull someone else into the discussion , then lets do it .
the current structure for allocating insurance costs does not provide the correct price signals to the business units as to the real cost of holding assets . this year we have been asked to increase our velocity of capital , cash flow , and our return on equity . corporate charges need to provide the correct incentives to accomplish this .
i suggest that you use the " cost of capital charge " as a model to allocate cost that can be re - assessed and re - allocated at least at mid - year . given that this year is waning , i suggest that you absorb " freed up " insurance capacity at the corp level . i imagine that if a business unit purchased an asset mid - year it would bear an allocation of insurance cost , so why not provide a savings when an asset is sold ?
i will call to set up a time we can meet .
regards ,
brian
p . s . i ' m not sure i understand what you mean by " once you complete your study of replacement cost values " - as nothing is being replaced ?

the 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $ 670 , 000 based upon ena ' s 2001 reported value of approximately $ 470 , 000 , 000 . the pro - rata credit for 7 months , assuming a 5 - 31 - 01 sale date , would be $ 390 , 833 .
underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal . gathering these values within enron normally requires 30 to 45 days . we use these same values in the allocation system . unless the value change is significant , the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values , we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted .
if we internally adjust your allocation mid - year , we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program . as you know , the remainder of enron did not stand still while you sold bammel . we have not tried this before , however , i suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ena ' s allocation , all the other operating entities would want to re - submit their revised values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment . in view of the time required , this is neither practical nor cost effective for enron . in view of the relatively small numbers , i doubt that corp . would entertain this proposition either , however , we can approach them if you wish .

please let me know how much of the 2000 insurance premium is being allocated to the approx . $ 700 mm of hpl assets . this charge is effectively " a cost of capital " and should be re - allocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at corp .

this insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage . values are adjusted annually at renewal . the premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds . in the event that we discontinue premiums to north america for hlp , we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured . in the event of a significant divestiture , underwriters may consider a refund , however , the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to enron ' s values as a whole . additionally , enron ' s adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures .
at renewal , 4 / 01 / 02 , north america ' s revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of enron ' s overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of enron .

please confirm that ena will not bear any insurance costs for the hpl assets for the second half of 2001 and the balance of years going forward ? if this is not the case , then we need to meet and discuss why this is not the case .
thanks ,
brian

in addition to the 188 , 371 , 296 property value for bammel lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for bammel gas storage of 267 , 000 , 000 . requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with aep not enron and thus the 2002 plan premium allocations of $ 754 , 096 on the bammel gas storage 267 , 000 , 000 value and $ 924 , 433 on the bammel lease value of 188 , 371 , 296 should not be needed .
jackie
please remove these amounts from the ena - hpl 2002 plan .

as discussed for the purposes of the 2002 insurance budget , we will delete the bammel lease ( 1409 ) property values of $ 188 , 371 , 296 . we will advise the insurers effective this past june to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund . however , as respects asset divestitures , insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience . however , if we are successful in receiving a credit , we will refund the premium .
i will discuss with karen and brian the other remaining assets .
