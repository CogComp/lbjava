i don ' t know what happened to my previous message , but here are the details .
td securities is sending a team of 9 people to the data room tomorrow morning . they should arrive between 8 and 8 : 30 wednesday morning and stay through thursday evening ( they are planning on a late night on wed ) .
we are currently planning on using room 3371 for the data room , but are looking for another room that might be more accomodating for such a large group . i will send you a list of td ' s team members as soon as i get it . please let me know who your point person will be and the schedule for the initial meetings .
thanks ,
mari
