subject : controls needed to ensure cashflows are received by infinity
shona , brent and sally ,
this morning , the cash flows from approximately 75 books were not received by
infinity from the erms system . we normally get 375 books and only got 296
this morning .
per conversation with joyce kuo and mike moscoso , susan trevino , risk
controls , and christian , rac , changed the book heirarchy on friday , moving
global products books , including the prepays , out of the ect group and into
another group . we have had discussions in the past verifying with risk
controls that the ect group is the only group which automatically sends its
cash flows to infinity . other cash flows from books are included only by
being listed in a script . this was not done when the books were moved from
the ect group on friday .
obviously , the rate & currency is not able to hedge enron ' s cash flows when
so much has been omitted . at this time we are about one hour away from a
good hedging report for the trading desk . this report is due the desk daily
by 7 : 30 am .
mike and i discussed the need for controls and sign - off by him or shona for
changes in book heirarchy .
